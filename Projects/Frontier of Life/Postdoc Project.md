### Context 
Recent efforts have been focused [[out-of-equilibrium process|out of equilibrium]] processes driven by environmental energy and matter intake, as a crucial step in transitioning from protocells to self-sustainable life-like units. 
Understanding and replicating the physicochemical interactions and deformation of protocell membranes under chemical signals will shed light on the fundamental mechanisms involved in the transition from pre-biotic compartments to cell-like architecture.

> > 2.2 Scientific Objectives The aim of this proposal is to engineer a minimal artificial cell capable of chemically driven directed motion and membrane interactions via lipid membrane deformation. This is motivated by work in the group of our partner Prof. Šarić (ISTA), where numerical simulations point towards localized membrane deformation via chemically active membrane sites. The proposal will tackle the following objectives: 1. Fabricate a robust library of giant lipid vesicles with localized deformable lipid domains. 2. Study membrane deformations such as protrusion and [[Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs)]] motion under controlled chemical fields. 3. Design chemically-driven protocell interactions via membrane deformation. We will leverage the previous expertise of our group with bioinspired active matter, and phase-separated GUVS. We will closely collaborate with our partner in ISTA (Austria), Prof. Anđela Šarić, a specialist in equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium membrane modelling with [[Monte Carlo numerical models]].

The project is divided in three interconnected work packages, each of them tackling one objective.

> chemical gradients will drive localized membrane deformations. We will fabricate Janus GUVs (DOPC:DPPC:Chol)19 with liquid- ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered (Ld) domains, equipped with internal synthetic motors (enzymatic Janus rods).
