## Fluid physics after light is turn on

In the presence of the thermal gradient for what i understand we will have: 

- [[Convection flows]]
- [[Thermophoresis]]
- [[Thermoosmosis]]

Those flows will drive the the motion of a particle, but thermoosmosis and thermophoresis are somewhat connected:

- Thermophoresis: A fluid flow slides along the surface
- Thermophoresis: A particle move in a still fluid due to interfacial effects
