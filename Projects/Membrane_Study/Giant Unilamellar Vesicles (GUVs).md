GUVs are synthetic analogues of cell membrane, typically formed by bilayers of amphiphilic lipids which allow encapsulation of biomolecules and selective permeability. 
---
Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) are spherical structures composed of a single lipid bilayer that encapsulates an aqueous core. 

  

**Key Features of GUVs:**

1. **Lipid Composition**:

• Formed from amphiphilic lipids that self-assemble into bilayers.

• The bilayer structure mimics the natural cell membrane, providing insights into membrane dynamics and properties.

2. **Size**:

• Typically range from 10 to 100 microns in diameter, making them easily observable under a light microscope.

3. **Encapsulation**:

• GUVs can encapsulate various biomolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules.

• This makes them valuable for studying biochemical reactions in a controlled environment.

4. **Selective Permeability**:

• The lipid bilayer allows selective transport of molecules, depending on size, charge, and hydrophobicity.

• This property is critical for mimicking cellular transport mechanisms.
