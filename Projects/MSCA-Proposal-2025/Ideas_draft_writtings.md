From a physics point of view, GUVs are a ideal system to study different physical properties of model cells, such as phase transitions, tension, fluctuations, curvature and non equilibrium dynamic. 

We usually use the following lipids:

[[DOPC]] (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine): [[unsaturated lipid]] that promote a disorder phase ([[Liquid-disorder-Ld]]). 

[[DPPC]]
