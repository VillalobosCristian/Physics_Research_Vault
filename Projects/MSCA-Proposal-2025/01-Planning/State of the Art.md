The emergence of life from non living matter represents one of the mysteries of science. The notion of that simple forces, such as thermal gradients, may have induce the necesasry interactions to create the first cells. 

Living cells display different kind of behaviors, they move, change shape, and exchance material with the environment. 


Recent interest in understanding the very beginning of life, and how prebiotic systems with environmental changes (T, pH, pressure, etc) and interactions amongst themselves and other inorganic systems, lead to the first minimal living system before eukaryotic cells [REF]. Understanding the minimal elements to build protocells and engineering these systems ‘in vitro’ allows for fundamental understanding of the beginning of life, but also has important implications in developing microscopic materials  [REF Laura, animated matter Roadmap].

 -  Talk about synthetic cells in general

– Talk about lipid vesicles in particular.

  

- These systems exhibit out-of-equilibrium processes as motility, communication and metabolism. Some of these behaviors have already been explored extensively in the domain of active in synthetic protocells, such as in motility 

Cell-inspired motility has fundamentally been studied for two decades using minimal systems such as colloids, and mimicking similar responsive motility [REFs laura articles light and magnetic responsive ,others]. Limitations and thus change to lipid vesicles.  
In the past years, the study of motility in lipid vesicles [refs light, magnetic, electric, viviens article]. 

Deformation in lipid vesicles is done via light-responsive molecules [refs], however, these are usually non-reversible due to the fast oxidation of lipids that control the local membrane properties

-interactions of particles with membranes [refs Stocco, Dimova?, Kraft, others]. Usually just in equilibrium, 

  

Interestingly, very little has been done using temperature-driven systems [REF Pietro Cicuta in phase separated systems] for motility, deformation and interactions with other species. Temperature is the source of thermal fluctuations, but also in vesicles, thermal expansion and competition between bending energy and tension, generating deformations in some cases. (maybe here bridge a bit on how temperature has been used in other microscopic soft matter systems, like colloids). Most importantly, temperature plays a crucial role on the membrane fluidity.

  

How shape transformations in membranes are related to motility, intake and exocytosis in lipid vesicles. 

Nevertheless, up to date, there is not an out-of-equilibrium experimental system equipped with localized domain membrane deformation, motility and membrane-membrane interaction mainly driven by temperature changes via light.**
