Vesicle dynamics govern fundamental cellular processes, including endocytosis, membrane fusion, and drug delivery, yet controlling and predicting vesicle behavior remains challenging due to the complex interplay between membrane adhesion, thermal fluctuations, and mechanical deformations. This project introduces thermally controlled vesicle manipulation as an innovative approach to systematically study how adhesion forces and membrane composition influence directed vesicle motion and shape changes.
