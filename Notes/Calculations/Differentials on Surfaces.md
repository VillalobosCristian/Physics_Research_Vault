# Differential Geometry of Surfaces

The idea is to represent a three-dimensional object as a surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$. To do that, we define the important characterizations:

**Parametric representation**:This is how to describe surfaces as a function of two variables. 
**Tangent Plane**: How partial derivatives define tangent vectors and local planar approximations. 
**Funtamental Forms**: The metric tensor (first fundamental form) and curvature (second fundamental form)
