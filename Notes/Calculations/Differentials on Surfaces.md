In many physical systems, we encounter \emph{interfaces} or \emph{membranes} separating different phases or media (e.g.\ liquid-vapor interfaces, lipid bilayers in cells, polymer-air boundaries). These interfaces can often be idealized as **two-dimensional** surfaces in three-dimensional space:
$$
  x^\mu = X^\mu(u^1, u^2),
  \quad \mu = 1,2,3,
$$
where $(u^1,u^2)$ are local coordinates (parameters) on the surface.
