 When performing the [[contour analysis of the vesicles]] we want to understand from those fluctuations how to extract information about the physical properties of the vesicle.
We will use mainly quasi-spherical vesicles, so oblate vesicles probably should be decompose differently. 

For a quasi spherical vesicle we will think about the shape change as a perturbation due to the thermal fluctuations. We can describe the time dependent radius of the vesicle as:
$$\begin{align}
\mathbf{R}(\theta,\phi,t)=\bar{R}(1+\epsilon)
\end{align}$$
