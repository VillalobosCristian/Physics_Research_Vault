# Week of 20 January

- Create GUV with [[Hydratation Method]], create DOPC GUV, with and without dye, try to focus in a range of size for the vesicles.


- See the fluctuations of the membrane for this case, try to recreate some of the results from the paper [[faizi2020_Fluctuation spectroscopy of giant unilamellar vesicles using confocal and phase contrast microscopy]]

- I would like also study the behavior of PS particles around the vesicles, and see the effect of local heating when used coated and uncoated glass. 

Mixing the ps particles in the suspension with vesicles it will be a good test to study the thermal fluctuation, both from vesicle shape and brownian motion.

- Changes in the behavior of particles close to the vesicle membrane it would be nice to see.
