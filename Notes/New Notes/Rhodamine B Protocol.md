1. Empty contents of 1 capsule into beaker

2. Add 40 mL Milli-Q water and dissolve
   - Stir until completely dissolved (<5 min)
   - This gives you 40 mL of 50 mM buffer

3. Transfer to 100 mL volumetric flask

4. Add Milli-Q water to 100 mL mark

5. Mix thoroughly

6. Check pH with meter:
   - Expected: pH 9.6
   - Acceptable: 9.5-9.7
   - This is close enough to the paper's 9.4

Result: 100 mL of 20 mM buffer, pH 9.6
For 10 mL of 10 mM rhodamine B stock: 
1. Weigh: 47.9 mg rhodamine B
2. Transfer to 10 mL volumetric flask 
3. Add ~8 mL Milli-Q water 4. Dissolve completely (vortex or stir 5-10 min)

To use it:

500 $\mu L$ of the stock at 10 mM in 45mL of buffer at 50mM
