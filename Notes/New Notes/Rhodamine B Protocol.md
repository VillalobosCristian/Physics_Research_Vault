1. Empty contents of 1 capsule into beaker

2. Add 40 mL Milli-Q water and dissolve
   - Stir until completely dissolved (<5 min)
   - This gives you 40 mL of 50 mM buffer

3. Transfer to 100 mL volumetric flask

4. Add Milli-Q water to 100 mL mark

5. Mix thoroughly

6. Check pH with meter:
   - Expected: pH 9.6

   - This is close enough to the paper's 9.4

Result: 100 mL of 20 mM buffer, pH 9.6
For 10 mL of 10 mM rhodamine B stock: 
1. Weigh: 47.9 mg rhodamine B
2. Transfer to 10 mL volumetric flask 
3. Add ~8 mL Milli-Q water 4. Dissolve completely (vortex or stir 5-10 min)

# Quality Control Checks

## Visual Inspection

### Buffer (20 mM)
```
✓ Clear, colorless solution
✓ No cloudiness or precipitation
✓ pH = 9.5-9.7
```

### Rhodamine Stock (10 mM)
```
✓ Deep magenta/pink color (very intense)
✓ Clear solution (no particles)
✓ No precipitation
```

### Working Solution (0.1 mM)
```
✓ Light magenta/pink color (less intense than stock)
✓ Perfectly clear after filtering
✓ No visible particles or cloudiness
✓ Uniform color throughout
```

## Optional: Concentration Verification

**Using UV-Vis spectrophotometer:**
```
Rhodamine B: λmax = 554 nm, ε = 106,000 M⁻¹cm⁻¹

For 0.1 mM stock diluted 1000×:
- Dilute 10 μL working solution to 10 mL
- Expected A554 ≈ 0.01 in 1 cm cuvette
```

# Usage Notes

## Before Each Experiment
```
1. Remove working solution from 4°C
2. Let warm to room temperature (30 minutes)
3. Mix gently by inversion
4. Check solution is still clear (no precipitation)
5. Use within 1-2 weeks of preparation
```

## Making Additional Working Solution
```
From your 10 mL stock, you can make more batches:
- Each 50 mL batch needs 0.5 mL stock
- 10 mL stock → up to 20 batches of 50 mL
- Always filter fresh working solution
```

## Safety Notes
```
⚠ Rhodamine B is a dye - avoid skin contact, wear gloves
⚠ Dispose of rhodamine waste properly (dye waste container)
⚠ Work in well-ventilated area
⚠ Consult SDS for detailed safety information
```

# Troubleshooting

## Problem: Rhodamine won't dissolve
**Solution:** 
- Stir longer (up to 15 minutes)
- Warm slightly (max 30°C)
- Check if powder is old/degraded

## Problem: Cloudiness after filtering
**Solution:**
- Filter is clogged - use new filter
- Solution may have precipitated - make fresh
- Check water quality

## Problem: pH outside range (9.5-9.7)
**Solution:**
- Verify capsule is Sigma C3041
- Check dilution calculation
- Small adjustments: add tiny amount Na₂CO₃ (raise) or NaHCO₃ (lower)

## Problem: Fluorescence too dim during experiments
**Solution:**
- Check concentration is correct
- Verify camera settings
- Check filter set matches rhodamine
- May need to increase camera exposure/gain

## Problem: Photobleaching observed
**Solution:**
- Increase ND filter strength (OD=2)
- Reduce exposure time
- Make fresh solution
- Minimize light exposure during storage

# Calculation Reference

## Buffer Dilution
```
1 capsule in 100 mL → 50 mM
Take 40 mL of 50 mM → dilute to 100 mL → 20 mM
Dilution factor: 2.5×
```

## Rhodamine Stock
```
MW = 479 g/mol
Target: 10 mM in 10 mL
Amount: 10 mM × 0.010 L × 479 g/mol = 47.9 mg
```

## Working Solution
```
C₁V₁ = C₂V₂
10 mM × 0.5 mL = C₂ × 50 mL
C₂ = 0.1 mM ✓
