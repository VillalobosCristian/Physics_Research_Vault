1. Empty contents of 1 capsule into beaker

2. Add 40 mL Milli-Q water and dissolve
   - Stir until completely dissolved (<5 min)
   - This gives you 40 mL of 50 mM buffer

3. Transfer to 100 mL volumetric flask

4. Add Milli-Q water to 100 mL mark

5. Mix thoroughly

6. Check pH with meter:
   - Expected: pH 9.6
   - Acceptable: 9.5-9.7
   - This is close enough to the paper's 9.4

Result: 100 mL of 20 mM buffer, pH 9.6

```
Materials:
□ 1 capsule Sigma C3041
□ ~150 mL Milli-Q water
□ 2.4 mg Rhodamine B (98+%)
□ 0.2 μm syringe filter
□ Amber bottle or aluminum foil

Steps:
1. Dissolve capsule in 40 mL water → add to 100 mL
   → 20 mM buffer pH 9.6
   
2. Dissolve 2.4 mg rhodamine B in 50 mL buffer
   → 0.1 mM rhodamine solution
   
3. Filter and store at 4°C in dark
```

**Output:**
- 100 mL buffer (20 mM, pH 9.6) - enough for several batches
- 50 mL rhodamine solution (0.1 mM) - ready for calibration + experiments
