> Bending rigidity of cellular membranes plays a key role in membrane remodeling. Knowledge of its value is needed to quantify processes that involve curvature changes such as [[Budding]] (as in endo- and exocytosis), tubulation and fusion. Various experimental methods have been devised to measure bending rigidity,1 e.g. micropipette aspiration,2,3 electrodeformation,4–7 optical tweezers,8,9 and scattering based techniques.10,11 One of the most popular methods is fluctuation spectroscopy, pioneered by Brochard and Lenon,12 due to its ease of implementation.6,13–15 In essence, a time series of vesicle contours in the focal plane (the equator of the quasi-spherical vesicle) is recorded. The quasicircular contour is decomposed in Fourier modes. The fluctuating amplitudes have variance dependent on the membrane bending rigidity and tension. Imaging is most commonly done by phase contrast microscopy1,6,14,16–21 but other methods such as confocal22–24 and light sheet microscopy25 have also been employed. The increased variety of imaging methods raises the question whether they all yield the same results.
