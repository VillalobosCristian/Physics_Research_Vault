Themophoresis in water moves particles along a temperature gradient. 
Typically is assumed that particle velocity $v$ is linear with the temperature gradient such as:

$$v = - D_{\mathrm{T}}\nabla T$$ where $D_{\mathrm{T}}=S_{\mathrm{T}}D$, is the thermophoretic mobility, with $S_{T}$ the [[Soret coefficient]], and $D$ the [[Diffusion coefficient]]. 

For small temperature gradients, the thermophoretic movement of the particles
