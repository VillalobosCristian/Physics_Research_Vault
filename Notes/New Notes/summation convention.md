When an index is repeated once as a subscript and once as a superscript in a product, it is summed over its entire range. For example:
$$  A^\mu B_\mu \;=\; \sum_{\mu=1}^{3} A^\mu B_\mu $$
$$  \partial_i X^\mu \,\partial_j X_\mu \;=\; \sum_{\mu=1}^{3} \left(\partial_i X^\mu\right)\,\left(\partial_j X_\mu\right).
$$


Likewise for $i,j$ if we have $g^{ij}g_{jk}=\delta^i_k$, etc.
