|50mM|100mM|200mM. we did hydration for those concentration of sucrose and glucose. 

We observe that for 50 mM concentration all the vesicles had inner vesicles and a lot of tubes in the suspensions. 

At 100 mM from the bottom of the tube, we had more vesicles in the sample and less vesicles with inner vesicles. 

At 200 mM this concentration produce the best vesicles, almost all were unilamellar, but still we observe some of the tubes in the suspension. 

The hydration method seems to depend a lot in the weather condition, also of the age of the lipids.

Stuff to try, submerge the glass in the chloroform and dry it with air-argon-nitrogen, ask which is the best way. 

We will try 300 and 400 mM sugar concentration
