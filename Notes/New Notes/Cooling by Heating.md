To-do. 

[  ] Use fluorescent microparticles as temperature probes to map the 2D temperature profile around the laser spot.
[  ] Calibrate temperature response with controlled heating experiments.
 - smaller particles to do PIV experiments?
 - Size particles? 
 - Force balance analysis
 - laser power analysis

# Analysis ideas

- Define the light zone in the first image, then start to doing the number of particles in time and studying the cluster formation. 
- Typical equation for the saturation process (before going 2-D), $N(t) = N_0(1-e^{-t/\tau})$  

## Convection

The Rayleigh number $\mathrm{Ra}$ determines whether buoyancy driven natural convection occurs. 
Is defined as: 
$$ \mathrm{Ra}?frac{}{}
