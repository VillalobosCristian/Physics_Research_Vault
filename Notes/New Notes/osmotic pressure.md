Osmotic pressure is the minimum external pressure that must be applied to a solution to prevent the net movement of solvent molecules across a semipermeable membrane. This movement, known as [[osmosis]], occurs when there is a difference in solute concentration between two solutions separated by the membrane. Essentially, osmotic pressure counteracts the natural tendency of the solvent to move from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration, thereby maintaining equilibrium between the two solutions.
