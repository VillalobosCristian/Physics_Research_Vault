## III. Quiz Answer Key

1. Lipid molecules are amphiphilic, possessing a hydrophilic head group and hydrophobic tails. In water, the hydrophobic tails aggregate to minimize unfavorable interactions with water, while the hydrophilic heads interact favorably with water, leading to the formation of bilayers driven by the hydrophobic effect and maximization of entropy for water molecules.
2. Bending rigidity (κ) is a measure of a membrane's resistance to bending deformations. It quantifies the energy required to bend the membrane. It can be experimentally determined by analyzing the [[Thermal fluctuations]] of vesicle shape using techniques like flicker spectroscopy.
3. The Helfrich Hamiltonian describes the bending energy of a lipid membrane as an integral over its surface involving the mean curvature (H) and [[Gaussian curvature]] (K). It is typically expressed as ∫ dA [2κ(H - c₀/2)² + κ̄K], where κ is bending rigidity, c₀ is [[Spontaneous curvature]], and κ̄ is the [[Gaussian curvature]] modulus. [[Spontaneous curvature]] represents the preferred curvature of the membrane due to lipid asymmetry or other factors.
4. [[Thermal fluctuations]] cause the shape of a nearly spherical vesicle to deviate constantly from a perfect sphere. The amplitudes of these fluctuations for different modes (described by spherical harmonics) are inversely proportional to the bending rigidity (κ) and increase with temperature (kT).
5. Spherical harmonics (Y*l*m) are a set of orthogonal functions defined on the surface of a sphere, used to decompose the shape of a nearly spherical vesicle into different modes of deformation. The index _l_ corresponds to the degree of the harmonic and relates to the number of nodes in the deformation pattern, while _m_ is the azimuthal order.
6. Membrane tension (σ) is a force per unit length acting within the plane of the membrane. It represents the energy cost to increase the membrane area. One example is an [[osmotic pressure]] difference between the interior and exterior of the vesicle, which tends to stretch the membrane.
7. The primary energetic factors are the adhesive energy between the particle and the membrane, which favors wrapping, and the bending energy of the membrane, which opposes wrapping by requiring deformation. A longer-range interaction potential can lower the adhesion threshold needed for full wrapping by allowing for a more gradual bending of the membrane.
8. The viscosity of the surrounding fluid damps the motion of the membrane, affecting the relaxation times of the shape fluctuations. Higher viscosity leads to slower relaxation of the fluctuation modes.
9. Curvature stress refers to the stresses that arise within a lipid bilayer due to its curvature. The mean curvature (H) and [[Gaussian curvature]] (K) of the membrane contribute to these stresses, which can influence the behavior of embedded proteins and the overall stability of the membrane.
10. Zeta potential is the electric potential at the slipping plane of a particle or vesicle, which is the interface between the surface and the bulk liquid. It is an indicator of the surface charge and the stability of colloidal systems; a higher magnitude of zeta potential generally implies greater electrostatic repulsion and thus higher stability against aggregation.
