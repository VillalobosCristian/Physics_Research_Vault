**What is the role of [[Thermal fluctuations]] in the context of particle uptake by GUVs?**

[[Thermal fluctuations]] generate transient deformations—small indentations and protrusions—that temporarily modify the [[local curvature]] of the membrane. These random undulations can lower the energy barrier for particle adhesion, facilitating the initial contact and subsequent uptake of particles by creating favorable binding sites.
The wrapping process depends on the competition between the elastic energy required to bend the membrane and the adhesive energy gained when the membrane contacts the particle. When the adhesive energy per unit area is high enough to overcome the bending (elastic) cost, the membrane deforms and wraps around the particle, leading to internalization.

## Literature Review Plan

The idea meanwhile well reproduced experiments are done is to do a small literature review focusing in the particle-membrane and environment interaction. 

I plan to separate this by:
