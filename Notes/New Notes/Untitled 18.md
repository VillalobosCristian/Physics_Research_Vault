"Reconstructing such functions in bottom-up platforms provides a route to disentangle universal physico-chemical contributions from organism-specific biological complexity, essential for understanding cellular behaviour and creating life-like materials. Cell motility represents a particularly compelling target, fundamental to biological processes from wound healing to immune responses, and critical for biotechnological applications including drug delivery and environmental sensing. Synthetic cells are emerging as simplified, controllable platforms to uncover fundamental physical principles while offering new biotechnological opportunities [REF]. Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) [REF] serve as minimal scaffolds to study membrane physics and protocell behaviour [REF]."
