"Reconstructing such functions in bottom-up platforms provides a route to disentangle universal physico-chemical contributions from organism-specific biological complexity, essential for understanding cellular behaviour and creating life-like materials. Cell motility represents a particularly compelling target, fundamental to biological processes from wound healing to immune responses, and critical for biotechnological applications including drug delivery and environmental sensing. Synthetic cells are emerging as simplified, controllable platforms to uncover fundamental physical principles while offering new biotechnological opportunities [REF]. Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) [REF] serve as minimal scaffolds to study membrane physics and protocell behaviour [REF]."



Cell motility represents a particularly compelling target, fundamental to biological processes from wound healing to immune responses, and critical for biotechnological applications including drug delivery and environmental sensing. Synthetic cells are emerging as simplified, controllable platforms to uncover fundamental physical principles while offering new biotechnological opportunities [REF roadmap]. Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) [REF] serve as minimal scaffolds to study membrane physics and protocell behaviour [REF].

Pioneering studies have achieved controlled membrane remodelling and motility in GUVs through diverse approaches. Remodelling techniques include light-responsive lipids [Dimova, Schwille], optical tweezers [Stocco], particle interactions [Kraft, Šarić], chemical gradients [Bishop], and temperature modulation [Talbot, Cicuta]. Motility has been engineered via optical manipulation [Dimova], magnetic actuation [Arriaga], bacterial propulsion [Durham], and patterned surface adhesion [Schwille]. Theoretical and computational models capture curvature–tension coupling and particle–membrane interactions, providing frameworks that guide experimental design [Šarić]. These studies demonstrate that physical triggers can induce life-like transformations.
