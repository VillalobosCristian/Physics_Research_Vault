Thanks for explaining the issue. The units and magnitude discrepancies could arise from several factors. Since you're working with images from the paper, the problem might be related to how the contour is extracted, how the Fourier modes are normalized, or the spatial calibration. Let’s go step by step to identify potential causes and how to fix them:

---

### 1. **Contour Extraction Accuracy**
   - **Pixel resolution**: Ensure you are correctly mapping pixel coordinates to real physical distances (e.g., microns per pixel). The paper might specify the pixel resolution, which should be used to convert pixel distances to physical units.
   - **Sub-pixel accuracy**: Contour detection from images can introduce errors if not done with sub-pixel interpolation. Consider using interpolation (e.g., parabolic or Gaussian fitting) to refine the detected contour.
   - **Out-of-focus artifacts**: If using images with fluorescence, signal "pollution" inside the vesicle may affect contour detection and result in incorrect amplitude values (especially for higher modes).

   **Solution**: Check the resolution in microns per pixel and apply sub-pixel refinement to the detected contour.

### 2. **Correct Fourier Normalization**
   Fourier mode normalization is essential. Ensure your formula matches the paper’s:
   \[
   u_q(t) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \left( r(\phi_n, t) - R_0 \right) e^{-iq\phi_n}
   \]
   - \( R_0 \) is the mean radius (baseline) of the vesicle contour.
   - If you skip subtracting \( R_0 \), the lower modes will be dominated by the overall vesicle size, leading to inflated mode magnitudes.
   - Ensure the correct scaling factor \( \frac{1}{N} \) is applied for proper normalization.


---

### 3. **Spatial Calibration**
   The fluctuation amplitudes are in **physical units (microns)** in the paper. Ensure that:
   - You convert the amplitude \( u_q \) from pixels to microns using the known resolution.
   - The mode number \( q \) corresponds to actual physical wavelengths:
     \[
     q = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}
     \]
     where \( \lambda \) is the mode’s wavelength in microns. Higher modes correspond to shorter wavelengths, which may be below the image resolution limit.


---

### 4. **Aliasing or Insufficient Angular Resolution**
   If your contour extraction has too few points, higher modes will not be captured accurately, leading to aliasing.
   - **Recommended**: Ensure you have at least \( N \geq 256 \) points for the contour.
   - If aliasing occurs, the magnitude of higher modes will behave unpredictably.

---

### 5. **Incorrect Handling of Confocal or Phase Contrast Images**
   The paper notes differences in mode resolution between phase contrast and confocal microscopy.
   - Phase contrast resolves more modes but may suffer from projection artifacts.
   - Confocal microscopy might have higher noise for high modes due to poor contour recognition.

   **Solution**: Filter your data to focus on modes below the resolution cutoff mentioned in the paper (mode \( q \approx 7 \)).

### Practical Steps to Debug:
1. **Check Spatial Calibration**: Convert your contour from pixels to microns.
2. **Normalize the Fourier Coefficients**: Subtract the mean radius \( R_0 \) and apply the correct scaling.
3. **Compare Mode Magnitudes**: Plot \( \langle |u_q|^2 \rangle \) vs \( q \) and verify
