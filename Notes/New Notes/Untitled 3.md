## **üé§ Slide 1: Title Slidex¬∫x¬∫¬∫**

_"Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today I'll be presenting our work on 'Shaping Lipid Membranes Via External Signals.' This is collaborative research between our group at the University of Bordeaux and our colleagues at ISTA-Austria. I'm Cristian Villalobos, and I'll be walking you through our approach to understanding how we can control membrane behavior using minimal synthetic systems."_

## **üî¨ Slide 2: Cells are not passive containers**

_"Let's start with the fundamental motivation. We often think of cell membranes as simple barriers, but they're actually incredibly dynamic structures. Living cells exhibit complex interactions with their environment - they're constantly responding and adapting."_

_"What's particularly fascinating is how membrane protrusions drive essential cellular functions. Whether it's locomotion - as you can see in this cell crawling example - sensory processes, or cell-to-cell communication, all of these depend critically on the membrane's ability to deform and fluctuate."_

_"As shown in this beautiful diagram, cells and their organelles are bounded by these complex membrane systems - from the plasma membrane to the nuclear envelope. The key insight is that¬†**all of these processes depend fundamentally on the membrane's ability to change shape**."_

---

## **üß™ Slide 3: Ingredients for a minimal synthetic cell**

_"So this raises the question: can we understand these complex membrane behaviors using simpler, more controlled systems? This is where the concept of minimal synthetic cells becomes powerful."_

_"We can think of this as a spectrum of complexity. On one end, we have full cellular complexity. But we can work backwards - using external fields to control membrane behavior, studying self-assembled bilayers, and at the most minimal level, simple lipid vesicles."_

_"The key insight, as shown in these examples from Dimova and the recent Nature Physics paper by Sciortino, is that¬†**membranes need shape changes to perform specific tasks**. Our approach is to study these fundamental interactions using minimal systems that we can precisely control."_

---

## **üéØ Slide 4: Objectives**

_"This brings us to our main objectives. We want to study membrane deformation - particularly protrusions and motion - under precisely controlled external fields."_

_"Our research focuses on three main areas:"_

_"First,¬†**cell remodeling**¬†- understanding how membranes naturally reshape themselves, which gives us insights into biological processes."_

_"Second,¬†**temperature-induced fluctuations**¬†- using controlled heating to drive membrane dynamics and shape changes."_

_"And third,¬†**particle-membrane interactions in chemical fields**¬†- exploring how concentration gradients and catalytic particles can influence membrane behavior."_

_"The common thread is that we're using controlled external signals to understand the fundamental physics of how membranes respond and reshape themselves."_

## **üî¨ Slide 5: Giant Unilamellar Vesicles**

_"Now let me introduce our experimental model system - Giant Unilamellar Vesicles, or GUVs. These are essentially artificial cell membranes that serve as perfect model systems."_

_"GUVs are large - typically 1 to 100 micrometers in diameter - with a thickness of only 5-10 nanometers. This makes them synthetic analogues of cell membranes that we can study in detail."_

_"What makes them so powerful is that they're minimal systems that bridge simple lipid physics with complex cellular functions. They give us a controlled platform to study fundamental membrane shape changes."_

_"We prepare our DOPC vesicles using the gentle hydration method - you can see our typical results here, with a beautiful population of spherical vesicles of various sizes."_

---

## **üåä Slide 6: Membrane Fluctuations**

_"Now let's talk about the physics. At the macroscale, we can treat a membrane as a thin continuous surface with mechanical properties that depend on the microscopic structure of the lipid bilayer."_

_"Most lipid membranes are fluid at room temperature, which means they undergo continuous shape fluctuations driven by thermal motion. This is the key insight -¬†**thermal motion alone is enough to deform these vesicles**."_

_"Think about the energy landscape: some deformations are expensive - like stretching or shearing - while others, like bending, are relatively cheap. This creates a hierarchy of fluctuation modes that we can analyze quantitatively."_

_"As you can see in this image, even at equilibrium, vesicles are constantly fluctuating. Our goal is to understand and eventually control these fluctuations."_

---

## **üìä Slide 7: Membrane Fluctuations: flickering spectroscopy**

_"This brings us to our main experimental technique - flickering spectroscopy. The idea is beautifully simple: for a nearly spherical vesicle, we can expand the shape mathematically."_

_"We parameterize the vesicle surface as r(Œ∏,œÜ,t) = R‚ÇÄ[1 + u(Œ∏,œÜ,t)], where R‚ÇÄ is the mean radius and u represents the small fluctuations around this spherical shape."_

_"The key insight is in the spherical harmonics expansion. We decompose these fluctuations into modes - each with a characteristic wavelength and amplitude. This is exactly analogous to Fourier analysis, but on a sphere."_

_"The time dependence captures the thermal fluctuations, while the spatial coordinates tell us about the shape deformations. This mathematical framework allows us to connect microscopic thermal energy to macroscopic membrane mechanics."_

---

## **‚ö° Slide 8: Helfrich Hamiltonian to Theory**

_"The theoretical foundation comes from the Helfrich Hamiltonian - this describes the energy cost of deforming a membrane. It includes bending rigidity Œ∫, tension œÉ, and pressure differences."_

_"The beautiful physics happens when we expand the mean curvature for small perturbations and apply the equipartition theorem. Each fluctuation mode gets exactly k_BT/2 of thermal energy."_

_"After some mathematical manipulations - expanding curvatures, applying statistical mechanics - we arrive at our key result: the mean square amplitude of each mode depends inversely on the energy cost of that deformation."_

_"This final equation is what we fit to our experimental data. It directly connects the bending rigidity Œ∫ and tension œÉ to the observable fluctuation amplitudes."_

---

## **üîç Slide 9: Getting mechanical properties from experiments**

_"Now let's see how this works in practice. For each frame of our time-lapse microscopy, we detect the vesicle contour with sub-pixel precision."_

_"We compute how much each point deviates from a perfect circle, then decompose this into circular harmonics - essentially Fourier modes around the equator."_

_"The key quantity we measure is the fluctuation amplitude - the mean-squared deviation from the time average. This removes any systematic drifts and focuses on the thermal fluctuations."_

_"Finally, we fit our theoretical model to this experimental spectrum to extract Œ∫ and œÉ. It's remarkable that from simple thermal fluctuations, we can determine fundamental mechanical properties with high precision."_

---

## **üìà Slide 10: Results**

_"Here are our results in action. These log-log plots show the fluctuation spectrum - amplitude versus mode number q - for different vesicles."_

_"The beautiful thing is that we can also measure temporal correlations. The bottom panels show how different modes decay over time - this gives us additional information about the membrane dynamics."_

_"Notice the clean power-law behavior in the spatial spectrum and the exponential decay in the temporal correlations. This confirms that our vesicles are truly in thermal equilibrium and validates our theoretical framework."_

---

## **üìä Slide 11: Analysis of Results**

_"When we analyze multiple vesicles, we find that the bending rigidity of DOPC is close to literature values - around 10-25 k_BT. This gives us confidence in our method."_

_"However, we've discovered something important: the values for both tension and bending rigidity are quite sensitive to the detection method. Small changes in how we detect the contour can significantly affect our results."_

_"This is why we're implementing a more robust detection algorithm. Having a well-defined baseline of mechanical properties is crucial for understanding how external fields affect membrane behavior."_

---

## **üå°Ô∏è Slide 12: Temperature induced fluctuations**

_"Now let me introduce our approach to actively controlling membrane behavior. We've developed an experimental system that uses light absorption as a heating source to induce shape changes."_

_"The setup is elegant: we have GUVs on a gold-coated glass substrate. When we illuminate with specific wavelengths - blue light around 450-495 nm or green light around 495-570 nm - the gold absorbs and creates localized heating."_

_"This allows us to create controlled temperature gradients and study how thermal energy affects membrane fluctuations and shape changes in real time."_

---

## **üîµ Slide 13: Temperature Results**

_"The results are quite striking. Under green light, we see relatively normal vesicle behavior. But when we switch to blue light, we observe dramatic shape changes - the vesicle develops pronounced deformations and asymmetries."_

_"This demonstrates that we can indeed use optical heating to actively control membrane shape. The different wavelengths create different heating patterns, leading to distinct membrane responses."_

---

## **üìè Slide 14: Characterizing the setup**

_"To properly understand these effects, we need to characterize our experimental setup. Our approach is to measure the induced temperature change by comparing diffusion coefficients."_

_"Since diffusion depends directly on temperature through the Einstein relation, by tracking particle motion under different light conditions, we can quantify the local temperature increase."_

_"The data shows clear differences in diffusion behavior between different optical powers and wavelengths, confirming that we're creating measurable temperature gradients."_

---

## **üíô Slide 15: Blue light effects**

_"One particularly interesting observation is what happens under blue light illumination. We see the formation of what appears to be colloidal crystal structures - particles organizing into ordered arrangements."_

_"This suggests that the optical heating is creating complex thermophoretic and convective flows that drive particle assembly. It's a beautiful example of how controlled energy input can create emergent organization."_

---

## **üîÆ Slide 16: Perspectives**

_"To summarize our current status and future directions: We've successfully demonstrated that flickering spectroscopy gives us reliable measurements of membrane mechanical properties for DOPC vesicles."_

_"We've identified that detection methods are crucial for accurate measurements, which is driving our development of more robust algorithms."_

_"Most importantly, we've shown that we can use controlled optical heating to actively manipulate membrane behavior - opening up new possibilities for studying membrane physics under non-equilibrium conditions."_

_"Looking ahead, this platform will allow us to systematically study how external fields - whether thermal, chemical, or mechanical - can be used to control membrane shape and function. This is a stepping stone toward truly controllable synthetic cells."_

Ah yes, let me correct that! Here's the revised commentary for slides 13-14:

## **üîµ Slide 13: Temperature induced fluctuations - Particle experiments**

_"To characterize our temperature control system, we use particles as probes. Here you can see the same experimental setup but now with particles dispersed in the solution."_

_"Under green light illumination, we see relatively normal particle behavior - they remain dispersed and show typical Brownian motion."_

_"But under blue light, something remarkable happens. The particles begin to show very different behavior - they start to organize and move in coordinated ways. This tells us that the blue light is creating significant temperature gradients and possibly thermophoretic forces."_

---

## **üìè Slide 14: Characterizing the setup - Particle diffusion**

_"To quantify these temperature effects, we track individual particle trajectories and measure their diffusion coefficients. Since diffusion is directly related to temperature through the Einstein relation D ‚àù T/Œ∑, this gives us a direct measure of local temperature changes."_

_"The left panel shows a field of particles that we track over time. The middle panel shows the mean squared displacement plots - the slope gives us the diffusion coefficient. And on the right, we see how diffusion varies with optical power."_

_"Notice the clear differences between the blue and orange data points - this confirms that different wavelengths and powers create measurable changes in local temperature and particle dynamics."_

_"But what's really exciting is what happens when we look at longer timescales under blue light..."_

---

## **üíô Slide 15: Blue light effects - 2D Crystal Formation**

_"Here's the remarkable result: under sustained blue light illumination, the particles spontaneously organize into highly ordered 2D crystalline structures!"_

_"You can see the dramatic transition from the disordered state at t=0 to the organized crystal structure. This isn't just heating - the optical forces and thermophoretic effects are creating conditions that favor crystallization."_

_"This demonstrates that our optical heating system can create complex, non-equilibrium conditions that drive fascinating self-organization processes. It's a beautiful example of how controlled energy input can create emergent order from disorder."_

This flow works much better - using particles to characterize the temperature effects, then showing the dramatic crystallization as evidence of the complex physics at play!
