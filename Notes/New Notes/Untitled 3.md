## Protocol for PVA-Assisted GUV Formation with DOPC

### Materials

- DOPC in chloroform (10 mg/mL)
- Pre-prepared PVA solution
- Sucrose
- Glucose
- 25 × 25 mm cover glass
- Vacuum chamber
- Oven or hot plate
- Micropipettes and tips
- Chamber formation materials (e.g., silicon or Teflon ring)

### Step 1: Prepare PVA-Sucrose Solution

Since you already have the PVA diluted, we'll just add sucrose to it:

1. Take a measured volume of your prepared PVA solution.
2. Calculate the amount of sucrose needed to achieve 50 mM concentration (for each 10 mL of PVA solution, you'll need 171.15 mg of sucrose).
3. Add the sucrose to the PVA solution and stir gently until completely dissolved. Mild heating (30-40°C) can help if needed.
4. Let the solution cool to room temperature before use.

### Step 2: Prepare PVA-Coated Cover Glass

1. Clean your 25 × 25 mm cover glass thoroughly. Plasma cleaning is ideal, but washing with ethanol and drying with nitrogen/filtered air works too.
2. Spin-coat 150 μL of your PVA-sucrose solution onto the cover glass (1,200 rpm for 30 seconds).
3. Place the coated glass in an oven at 80°C for 30 minutes to dry the PVA film completely.
4. Allow the glass to cool slightly but use while still warm (around 40-50°C) for the next step.

### Step 3: Deposit Lipid Solution

1. Your DOPC is at 10 mg/mL in chloroform, which is more concentrated than needed. Dilute it to 1 mg/mL by adding 100 μL of your stock to 900 μL of fresh chloroform.
2. Take 5-10 μL of the diluted 1 mg/mL DOPC solution.
3. Deposit it uniformly onto the center of the still-warm PVA-coated glass. For better control of the deposition area, you can use a silicone or Teflon ring to create a boundary.
4. Alternatively, spin-coat the lipid solution briefly at low speed (300-500 rpm for 5-10 seconds) to create a more uniform layer.

### Step 4: Dry the Lipid Film

1. Place the lipid-coated cover glass in your vacuum chamber.
2. Apply vacuum for at least 2 hours at room temperature to ensure complete evaporation of the chloroform.

### Step 5: Form the Swelling Chamber

1. Use a silicone or Teflon ring to create a chamber on the lipid-coated side of the cover glass. Secure it with a thin layer of vacuum grease if needed.
2. Prepare your 200 mM sucrose solution for the swelling process (this will be the interior solution for your vesicles).
3. Gently add 1 mL of the 200 mM sucrose solution to the chamber.
4. The vesicles should begin forming immediately, but allow 10-30 minutes for optimal formation.
5. Keep the chamber at room temperature during swelling, as DOPC has a very low transition temperature and PVA dissolution won't be a concern.

### Step 6: Harvest the Vesicles

1. Prepare an Eppendorf tube with 1 mL of your 225 mM glucose solution.
2. To detach vesicles from the PVA surface, gently pipette up and down about 200 μL of the buffer solution close to the glass surface (without touching it).
3. Alternatively, gently tap the sides of the chamber or try the inversion technique mentioned in the protocol (securing the chamber to a petri dish and inverting it briefly).
4. Using a cut pipette tip (to minimize shear stress), carefully collect the solution containing the vesicles.
5. Transfer the collected solution to your prepared Eppendorf tube containing the glucose solution.
6. Mix very gently by slowly tilting the tube back and forth a few times.
7. Allow the mixture to settle for 10-15 minutes before observation.

### Step 7: Observation

1. Take a small sample from the mixture for observation.
2. The density difference between the internal sucrose and external glucose should cause the vesicles to settle to the bottom of your observation chamber, making them easier to locate.
3. The osmotic gradient (225 mM glucose outside vs. 200 mM sucrose inside) will create the desired floppy vesicle morphology.

This protocol combines the advantages of PVA-assisted swelling with your desired sucrose/glucose gradient system for creating floppy DOPC vesicles. The addition of sucrose to the PVA solution should enhance the swelling process and improve your vesicle yield significantly.
