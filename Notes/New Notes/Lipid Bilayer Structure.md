A lipid bilayer is composed of amphiphilic lipid molecules arranged so that their hydrophobic tails face inward and hydrophilic heads face the aqueous environment. This [[self-assembled]] structure is the basis of all biological membranes.

**Key Parameters:**
- **Lipid Length Scale:** Lipid molecules are 1–2 nm in length.  
- **Bilayer Thickness:** Typically 4–5 nm.  
- **Bilayer Fluidity:** Lipid bilayers behave like 2D fluids; lipids diffuse laterally with diffusion coefficients on the order of $10^{-8} \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s}$

Because of the two tails the hydrophobicity is strong, therefore there is not exchange between the bilayer and the bulk. 
For example of [[Micelles]], the hydrophobicity is not that strong and the number of monomers can fluctuate by exchange with the bulk. 

The bilayer also have steric repulsions, which make that exist a prefer distance between each other.

The order within the biological membrane is a fluid-like, meaning that the lipid molecules can diffuse in the $2-D$ plane of the membrane.

### Interfacial Tension

The interfacial tension of the membrane can be computed as:

$$\sigma = \frac{\partial F}{\partial A}|_{A_0}=0$$
Where $A$ is the area of the membrane, and $A_0$ is the prefer area. There is not interfacial energy, so is not trying to minimize the surface area unlike a soap bubble or a emulsion droplet. 
In the case of emulsion droplets, there is surfactant molecules that can go into the bulk, and therefore the number of molecules can always adjust in order to maintain the area as a minimum. 

In the case of the bilayer the number of molecules in the interface is fixed so is not possible, unless compression or bending of the membrane happens, that cost energy. 

## Surface free energy

$$F_s=\frac{1}{2}\kappa_s\left(\frac{A-A_0}{A_0}\right)$$

 Doing this, has a cost of $F_s$. 

## Bending

Because the membrane has thickness, it also cost energy to bend the membrane.
