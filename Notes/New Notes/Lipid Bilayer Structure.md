A lipid bilayer is composed of amphiphilic lipid molecules arranged so that their hydrophobic tails face inward and hydrophilic heads face the aqueous environment. This self-assembled structure is the basis of all biological membranes.

**Key Parameters:**
- **Lipid Length Scale:** Lipid molecules are 1–2 nm in length.  
- **Bilayer Thickness:** Typically 4–5 nm.  
- **Bilayer Fluidity:** Lipid bilayers behave like 2D fluids; lipids diffuse laterally with diffusion coefficients on the order of $10^{-8} \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s}$
