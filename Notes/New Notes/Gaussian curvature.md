## Gaussian Curvature
Given a point on the surface, we can determine the normal vector a that point. Demanding that the length of this vector is $1$, so that this vector can be contain within a unit sphere whose tip is now on the sphere. 

The process of going form a point on the surface to a point on the unit sphere is called [[Gauss map]]

Here $\kappa$ is the Gaussian curvature. 
$$\kappa = \lim_{\mathcal{A}\to 0}  \frac{A^N}{A^S}$$
$\mathcal{A}$ is the area of the patch.
