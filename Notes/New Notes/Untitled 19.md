However, **quantitative relationships between motility, adhesion** strength and membrane composition under controlled stimuli **remains unexplored** [REF]. Thus, a crucial gap remains: To date, no study has examined coupling between **GUV membrane deformation** and **motility** of simple-composition **GUVs across tunable adhesion regimes** [REF]. It is well established that microscopic soft matter systems, including GUVs, are governed by thermal fluctuations. Many groups have exploited the potential of temperature-driven reorganization in colloids [Chico, Maitane, Šarić] and active assemblies [Volpe, Alvarez, vanKestern/Alvarez], but little has been done for GUVs [REF lasers]. In membranes, temperature dictates bending rigidity, tension [REF book dimova/specific papers], and phase behaviour [REF phase Veacher]. Interestingly, under slow bulk heating, phase-separated GUVs reorganize and can undergo extreme deformations due to temperature-modulated lipid-domain line tension [Cicuta]. Yet, temperature remains an **underexploited actuation** parameter in the context of GUVs. **These gaps define a unique opportunity**: by combining **low-intensity** **light-driven temperature control** with **vesicle mechanics and dense environments**, we can establish a new physical route to program and study **protocell out-of-equilibrium** behaviours. Although **GUV deformation and transport** have been explored separately, **their coupling driven solely by controlled temperature (without photochemical modification or complex membrane chemistries) remains unexplored.**![[WhatsApp Image 2025-07-11 at 15.43.40.jpeg]]
