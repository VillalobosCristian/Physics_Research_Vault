However, **quantitative relationships between motility, adhesion** strength and membrane composition under controlled stimuli **remains unexplored** [REF]. Thus, a crucial gap remains: To date, no study has examined coupling between **GUV membrane deformation** and **motility** of simple-composition **GUVs across tunable adhesion regimes** [REF]. It is well established that microscopic soft matter systems, including GUVs, are governed by thermal fluctuations. Many groups have exploited the potential of temperature-driven reorganization in colloids [Chico, Maitane, Šarić] and active assemblies [Volpe, Alvarez, vanKestern/Alvarez], but little has been done for GUVs [REF lasers]. In membranes, temperature dictates bending rigidity, tension [REF book dimova/specific papers], and phase behaviour [REF phase Veacher]. Interestingly, under slow bulk heating, phase-separated GUVs reorganize and can undergo extreme deformations due to temperature-modulated lipid-domain line tension [Cicuta]. Yet, temperature remains an **underexploited actuation** parameter in the context of GUVs. **These gaps define a unique opportunity**: by combining **low-intensity** **light-driven temperature control** with **vesicle mechanics and dense environments**, we can establish a new physical route to program and study **protocell out-of-equilibrium** behaviours. Although **GUV deformation and transport** have been explored separately, **their coupling driven solely by controlled temperature (without photochemical modification or complex membrane chemistries) remains unexplored.**![[WhatsApp Image 2025-07-11 at 15.43.40.jpeg]]



Living cells exhibit complex interaction pathways to respond and adapt to their environment. In particular, interaction with the environment via membrane protrusions facilitate locomotion[], sensory, and communication processes. The significance of protrusions extends to eukaryogenesis (evolution of eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic ancestors), with recent theories pointing to the importance of membrane deformations as source of evolutionary innovation fro “complex” organism (e.g, eukaryotes). At an early evolutionary stage, protocells-considered precursors to living cells, might have transitioned from non-living to living units by benefiting from similar boundary interactions.
