# COMPREHENSIVE PROMPT FOR MSCA PROPOSAL INTRODUCTION REFINEMENT

## **CONTEXT:**

I'm working on the Introduction and State of the Art section for a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Postdoctoral Fellowship proposal in physics. This section is critical for capturing reviewers' attention and must balance fundamental physics depth with practical impact and accessibility.

## **THE PROPOSAL CORE:**

**Title/Focus**: Establishing an optothermal platform to dynamically control membrane deformations and motility in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) through thermal-adhesion coupling.

**Key Innovation**: Using simple metal thin films with standard fluorescence microscopy equipment to create precise, accessible thermal control of synthetic cell behavior - no lasers or complex chemistry required.

## **THE PHYSICS FOUNDATION:**

**Fundamental Question**: How does thermal driving couple with membrane elasticity and surface adhesion in non-equilibrium regimes to generate controlled structural transformations and motility?

**Theoretical Framework**: Extending established models (Canham-Helfrich, contact angle theory, van't Hoff relations) into unexplored coupled thermal-mechanical-adhesive regimes.

**Physics Goals**:

- Discover universal response functions relating temperature gradients, adhesion regimes, and membrane composition to vesicle dynamics
- Map non-equilibrium phase diagrams (equilibrium/deformed/detached/ruptured/budding states)
- Uncover scaling laws governing thermal-driven soft matter systems

## **EXPERIMENTAL STRATEGY (3 Work Packages):**

**WP1**: Baseline studies - GUVs under different adhesion regimes at room temperature to establish mechanical/adhesive references

**WP2**: Uniform thermal control - Full-field illumination creating radial flows that average to near-zero over vesicle zones, isolating direct thermal effects on membrane properties (κ(T), σ(T)) and thermal-adhesion coupling

**WP3**: Gradient thermal control - Using metal thickness gradients (not diaphragm control) to create asymmetric thermal fields and study motility. Example: DPPC (gel state) vs DOPC (fluid) vesicles in thermal gradient - will gel vesicles move like rigid objects while fluid vesicles use extreme deformations?

## **KEY PHYSICS INSIGHTS:**

- **Phase-dependent responses**: How membrane phase state (gel/fluid) fundamentally changes thermal-mechanical response
- **Coupled non-equilibrium dynamics**: Individual components understood, but coupled thermal-membrane-adhesion system unexplored
- **Emergent motility**: How microscopic thermal-mechanical interactions generate macroscopic directional motion
- **Universal principles**: Response functions and scaling laws in driven membrane systems

## **NOVELTY/BREAKTHROUGH POTENTIAL:**

**Scientific**: First systematic exploration of thermal-adhesion coupling in synthetic cells, extending established theoretical frameworks into new regimes

**Technical**: Democratizing thermal control - accessible platform using equipment available in any fluorescence microscopy lab (vs expensive lasers/complex chemistry)

**Versatility**: Platform enables multiple applications - spatial control from 40μm to full field of view, applications from protocell motility to colloidal crystal manipulation

## **MSCA CONTEXT REQUIREMENTS:**

**Audience**: Physics reviewers who need to see fundamental scientific advance, not just applications **Fellowship criteria**: Must demonstrate excellence, innovation, and potential for breakthrough discoveries **Balance needed**: Fundamental physics depth while showing practical impact and accessibility

## **CURRENT INTRODUCTION ISSUES:**

The draft introduction (provided below) has several problems:

- Missing spaces and formatting errors
- Doesn't capture the physics depth adequately
- Loses the accessibility advantages in technical details
- Redundant phrasing and unclear narrative flow
- Doesn't convey the breakthrough potential convincingly

## **TASK:**

Review the current introduction draft and help refine it to create a compelling, physics-focused narrative that:

1. Hooks physics reviewers with fundamental questions
2. Establishes the theoretical foundation and extension opportunity
3. Emphasizes the systematic experimental approach needed for discovering universal principles
4. Highlights accessibility as enabling broader theoretical validation
5. Positions this as breakthrough physics research worthy of MSCA funding
6. Maintains technical accuracy while improving readability and impact

**Balance**: 70% fundamental physics emphasis, 30% practical impact/accessibility - this is physics research that happens to be accessible, not applied research that happens to use physics.
