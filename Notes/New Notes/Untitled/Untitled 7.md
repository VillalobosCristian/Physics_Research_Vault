# **Temperature-Driven Control of Lipid Vesicles – Science Backbone**

## Executive Summary (Key Findings & Parameters)

- **Localized photothermal heating drives vesicle **_motility_** and **_deformation_**:** A focused laser on a thin gold film (e.g. 10 nm Au, blue/green light) creates steep temperature gradients that push fluid and particles via thermophoresis and thermo-osmotic flows. Vesicles move up to a few µm·s^−1 under modest ∇T (e.g. Soret mobility **D**T ≈ 0.3 µm^2·K^−1·s^−1), and near surfaces interfacial flows reach 10–100 µm·s^−1, enabling swift, contact-free manipulation. Millisecond thermal response times allow rapid, reversible shape changes: a ~9 °C local increase (sub-second) expanded a vesicle–vesicle contact by ~60% (from 9 to 15 µm interface), demonstrating light-driven budding/adhesion control without permanent damage.
    
- **Membrane mechanics (bending & tension):** A single-component fluid membrane’s bending rigidity **κ** is on the order of 10^−19 J. For DOPC (unsaturated), κ ≈ (4–8)×10^−20 J (~10–20 kBT); for DPPC (saturated, fluid phase) κ ≈ 2–4×10^−19 J (~50–100 kBT) when cholesterol-enriched. In liquid-ordered (Lo) vs disordered (Ld) phase-separated bilayers (e.g. DOPC/DPPC/Chol), Lo domains are 2–3× stiffer than Ld. Giant vesicles typically exhibit very low membrane tension **σ** (~10^−8 to 10^−7 N·m^−1) in the absence of external forces, reflecting a floppy, tensionless state; this corresponds to a dimensionless tension **Σ̃** = σR^2/κ ≲ 1 for a 10 µm vesicle (σ̃ often ~0.1–10 in thermal fluctuation analyses). Controlled micropipette aspiration can tune σ up to ~10^−5 N·m^−1 (order 0.01 mN·m^−1) before lysis.
    
- **Domain line tension & phase behavior:** At room temperature (~23 °C), the boundary line tension between Lo/Ld domains in a DOPC/DPPC/Chol membrane is on the order of **γ** ~1 pN (∼10^−12 N, or equivalently ~2×10^−6 J·m^−2). Line tension drops near the miscibility transition: approaching Tc (where domains dissolve), γ can fall to <0.1 pN and domains become sub-micron (critical fluctuations). Far below Tc, γ rises to a few pN, driving domain coalescence and even **budding** of domains into separate vesicle buds to reduce boundary length. For a typical ternary (1:1:1) raft mixture, γ ≈ 1–5 pN yields circular domains of few–10 µm; applying lateral tension or adding line-active molecules can modulate γ by ~±50%.
    
- **Photothermal capabilities (blue/green light on Au films):** Thin Au coatings (10–50 nm) under focused visible light (λ ≈ 488–532 nm) act as microscale heaters. A ~2 mW laser spot (≈1 µm radius) on a 50 nm Au film produces a temperature rise of ΔT ~10–20 K at the surface and decays over ~5–10 µm laterally. The heat diffusion is extremely fast: thermal equilibration in water over ~1 µm occurs in <100 µs, enabling kHz-rate temperature modulation. Higher powers (50–100 mW) or plasmonic nanoantennas can generate very large local ΔT (100 K+), but moderate irradiance (≤10 kW·cm^−2) is used to avoid bulk heating. _Result:_ spatially patterned light (via digital micromirror or scanning) can create arbitrary **thermal landscapes** on-chip, imparting forces and flows to guide vesicles along specified paths or induce desired deformations on timescales <<1 s.
    
- **Motility and deformation metrics:** Experimentally, opto-thermal gradients have achieved vesicle **drift speeds**of ~1–10 µm·s^−1 for single GUVs (diameter ~10–20 µm) attracted to a laser hot-spot. Near a heated substrate, vesicles experience a **Marangoni/thermo-osmotic “pull”**, easily moving 5–20 µm in a few seconds to reach a 5 K hotter region. Light-triggered **shape changes** include observable pole flattening or protrusion under a focused beam (as one side of the vesicle warms and membrane tension locally decreases). A 9 °C increase induced ~15° increase in contact angle in an adhering vesicle pair (signifying enhanced membrane compliance). Thresholds for **budding/tubulation** can be defined by competition of bending vs line tension: e.g. ~2–5 pN line tension suffices to bud a ~5 µm domain on a vesicle with κ ~10^−19 J. In practice, photothermal stimuli can reversibly bud small (~2 µm) lipid domains or retract them by toggling illumination (demonstrated with phase-separating GUVs under a moving laser) – an important step toward on-demand protocell shape morphing.
    
- **Adhesion energies (vesicle–vesicle or vesicle–particle):** Specific membrane tethering schemes yield adhesion energy densities **W** in the 10^−4–10^−2 J·m^−2 range (0.1–10 mJ·m^−2). **Biotin–streptavidin** linkages (high affinity, multivalent) typically produce W ≈ 1–5 mJ·m^−2 at full coverage (comparable to ~0.5–1.0 mJ·m^−2 measured for salt-screened POPC vesicles). **DNA-based adhesion** (using complementary DNA lipid tethers) is tunable by DNA length and surface density: e.g. ~48-base duplex tethers at ~2000 µm^−2 yield W ≈ 0.5 mJ·m^−2, whereas sparser or shorter (~16 bp) linkers give W ~0.01–0.1 mJ·m^−2. These energies are sufficient to immobilize vesicles (radii ~5–10 µm) on surfaces or each other, overcoming thermal undulations (typical thermal adhesion energy ~10^−6 J·m^−2). _Methods:_ Reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICM) and micropipette force balance are used to extract W from the zero-tension contact angle. Notably, **reversibility**varies: biotin-streptavidin bonds are quasi-irreversible (k_d <10^−6 s^−1), whereas DNA bonds can be thermally or chemically dehybridized to release vesicles on-demand.
    
- **Photodamage mitigation:** To preserve membrane integrity under illumination, **wavelength** and **intensity** must be chosen judiciously. UV/violet light (365–405 nm) or even 488 nm can generate singlet oxygen and lipid peroxides, especially in presence of fluorescent dyes, causing membrane leakage or “vesicle explosion” after prolonged exposure. Using **longer wavelengths (λ ≥ 532 nm)** and minimizing oxygen dramatically reduces photo-oxidation. In practice, investigators include reactive oxygen scavengers (e.g. 5 mM Trolox, 50 mM glucose + glucose oxidase/catalase) in GUV chambers to allow hours of imaging at 488 nm with negligible lipid damage. Lipid oxidation can be quantified by fluorescent assays (C11-BODIPY oxidation sensor) or monitoring increased membrane area/fluidity: e.g. photo-oxidation can expand membrane area by >20% and lower κ ten-fold in extreme cases. Our system will operate in a “safe regime” (<0.2 W·cm^−2 blue light, with antioxidants present), validated by control tests (no change in Laurdan GP or in leakage of encapsulated calcein over >30 min illumination).
    
- **Measurement toolkit & best practices:** **Flicker spectroscopy** (fast video microscopy of thermal shape fluctuations) provides κ and σ by fitting the power spectral density of contour modes to the Helfrich spectrum. Careful calibration of imaging magnification and minimizing external flows are critical; typically modes ℓ=3–10 are fitted, and one checks for consistency across frame rates. **Micropipette aspiration** measures σ and area expansion: known relations (Laplace’s law ΔP = 2σ/R_pipette for a held vesicle tongue) yield σ from the suction pressure, while incremental area uptake under higher ΔP gives the area compressibility modulus K_a. Precautions include using <5% aspiration for κ measurements to keep the membrane in the enthalpic stretching regime negligible. **RICM** is ideal for adhesion geometry: by analyzing interference fringes, one maps the separation field z(r) in the contact zone and extracts the equilibrium contact angle and adhesion energy via elastic models. It requires flat substrates and known refractive indices; vibrations or fluctuating vesicles can blur interference patterns (often damped by slight sucrose asymmetry to make vesicles heavier). **AFM (colloidal probe)** directly measures force–distance as a micron-sized bead (or functionalized tip) pushes into a vesicle. From the force at point of contact or detachment, one infers adhesion energy (with appropriate JKR/Deryagin assumptions for a soft membrane). Key is to calibrate cantilever sensitivity and avoid high loading rates that cause hydrodynamic drag artifacts. **Laurdan GP microscopy** is the workhorse for **local membrane order/temperature**: Laurdan’s emission shift (generalized polarization) drops ~0.3 units upon melting of lipid tails, allowing imaging of phase state or even mapping a temperature gradient across a vesicle. A two-point GP calibration (fluid vs gel at known T) and correction for dye bleaching are recommended; one must also consider Laurdan’s ~5 µs lifetime – use gated detection to avoid contamination by autofluorescence. By combining these tools (flicker for mechanics, GP for fluidity, RICM for contact geometry), we ensure quantitative, cross-validated measurements of our protocell behavior.
    
- **Theory–experiment links:** The **fluctuation spectrum** for a tension–bending dominated membrane is given by: _〈|h(q)|^2〉 = k_B T / [σq^2 + κ(q^4)]_, where h(q) are Fourier modes of the height. Fitting this yields σ (from the q^2 term) and κ (from q^4 term) – we will use this canonical formula (with corrections for finite vesicle size and optical point-spread, as needed). For **particle wrapping**, the classic criterion (ignoring tension) is _W_c = 2κ/R_p^2_: adhesion energy per area must exceed twice the bending energy per area of curvature 1/R_p for a particle of radius R_p. Including tension Σ, the condition becomes _W_c ≈ (2κ/R_p^2) + Σ_ (for partial wrapping, Σ term opposes wrapping a flat membrane). In practice, sub-micron particles require W on order 10^−3–10^−2 J·m^−2 to wrap fully. These criteria guide our design of DNA stickers and membrane tension: e.g. a 500 nm colloid (R_p=0.5 µm) with κ=10^−19 J and σ=10^−8 N·m^−1 would need W > ~3×10^−4 J·m^−2 to be engulfed – achievable with our DNA tethers (≥0.5 mJ·m^−2). We will test these predictions by varying tether density and observing wrapping outcomes, bridging quantitative theory with experiment.
    
- **State of the art vs our approach:** Prior **light-driven vesicle systems** mainly achieved **either** motility or shape change, but not an integrated, high-control platform. Opto-thermophoretic tweezers (Zheng et al. 2018) trapped vesicles and moved them in 2D/3D, but did not exploit phase separation or induce specific shape remodeling. Bendix and others used IR-heated gold nanoparticles to locally **permeabilize or melt** GUV membranes, demonstrating spatially resolved content release, yet vesicle translation was not controlled. **Magnetic actuation:**GUVs with embedded magnetic nanoparticles have shown prolate deformation in DC fields and chain assembly in field gradients; however, magnetic control lacks fine spatial addressability (fields permeate the whole sample) and can require high fields for small vesicles. **Enzyme-driven protocells:** synthetic motile vesicles with enzymatic pumps (e.g. catalase producing O_2) achieve autonomous motion (~5–10 µm·min^−1) by self-generated chemo-gradients, but steering is diffuse and coupling to membrane mechanics (e.g. shape change) is minimal. Moreover, many enzyme-driven vesicles are multi-component (polymersome hybrids) and **irreversible**– once fuel is spent or product builds up, motion ceases. In contrast, our photothermal approach offers on-demand, spatially programmable activation with instantaneous on/off and **no chemical consumption**. **Limitations of existing methods:** Light-induced lipid oxidation (in some photosensitizer-based systems) is irreversible and can destroy vesicles; magnetic or acoustic manipulation can’t easily target one vesicle among many. Our strategy overcomes these by using pure photothermal forces (no chemical modification of lipids) and the intrinsic reversibility of heating: vesicles return to their original state when light is off (no permanent bonds broken/formed). To our knowledge, no prior work has **simultaneously** demonstrated precise vesicle locomotion, controlled deformation, and selective domain reorganization in a single, unified platform – this is the gap our project will fill, leveraging each partial advance from literature in a synergistic manner.

## 2. **Addressing Key Questions (Excellence & Novelty)**

### 2.1 Evidence for Localized ΔT-Driven Motility and Deformation

**Prior evidence:** A localized temperature increase can indeed propel and distort lipid vesicles. The strongest evidence comes from **opto-thermal trapping** studies. Hill _et al._ (2018) showed that a focused laser (532 nm, ∼mW power) near a planar substrate can attract lipid vesicles _toward the hotter region_, effectively creating an optical thermal trap. This occurs despite pure water’s tendency for thermophoresis to drive objects from hot to cold at ambient conditions; the vesicle’s environment (ionic strength, etc.) can invert the Soret effect or, as Zheng’s team found, lowering ambient temperature flips thermophoresis to attractive. The key mechanisms are: **(i) Thermophoresis (Soret effect):** solute or lipid bilayer asymmetries cause the vesicle to drift along ∇T; typically, colloids in water move toward cold (negative Soret coefficient) under standard conditions, but if the vesicle carries a surface charge or if temperature alters local ion clouds, a **thermo-electric field** can pull it hot-ward. **(ii) Thermo-osmosis:** as demonstrated by Würger, Joly, and others, a temperature gradient along a boundary induces a flow of liquid adjacent to that surface (the liquid–solid interaction “perturbation” by thermal gradients). In our context, a gold-coated slide with a laser spot generates a radial thermo-osmotic flow dragging nearby vesicles inward. This effect dominated in the ETH Zürich experiments of 2022, where 50 nm Au films produced ~50 µm·s^−1 interfacial flows that reliably corralled nanoparticles. For a larger vesicle (10 µm), similar flows act like moving conveyor belts in the boundary layer, transporting the vesicle laterally. **(iii) Marangoni stress:** if there is any interfacial tension gradient (e.g. at an air–water interface or even along a curved vesicle if one side’s membrane tension is reduced by heating), fluid will flow from low-tension to high-tension regions. A heated patch on a vesicle can lower local membrane tension (via thermal area expansion of lipids), causing lipid flow away from the hot spot and potentially inducing shape changes (like a slight bulge at the hot pole). In liquid droplets, Marangoni flows are dramatic; for closed bilayers, the effect is subtler but analogous: a local drop in **σ** at the hot pole relative to the cold side can drive tangential stress over the vesicle surface, redistributing lipids or domains.

**Vesicle deformations under thermal stimuli** have been reported in a few contexts. The Bendix group (2014) provided direct evidence that **localized membrane melting** (gel→fluid) by a heated Au nanoparticle causes dynamic shape changes: as the Au NP approached a GUV membrane, the local region melted and the GUV expanded outward there, sometimes forming a transient blister or pore. They visualized this with a fluorescent phase probe and saw _calcein release_ events at the heated spot, confirming nanoscale deformation/permeation. Separately, Parolini _et al._ (2018) showed that uniform heating of adhering vesicles can increase their contact area (by softening the membranes). Our project will leverage these mechanisms: a tightly focused laser yields spatially asymmetric heating (unlike a global temperature jump), so we expect _anisotropic_ deformation – e.g. vesicle elongation toward the heat source, akin to a “thermal pole”. Preliminary calculations (Appendix) indicate that a 5 K gradient across a 20 µm vesicle could reduce the bending energy at the hot pole enough to cause ~5% increased curvature there, consistent with a slight protrusion.

**Summary of mechanisms dominance:** In our operating regime (vesicles near a heated surface in aqueous medium), **thermo-osmotic flow** at the substrate likely dominates lateral vesicle motion (fast, boundary-confined flow), while **thermophoresis** (bulk Soret drift) provides additional pull in 3D (especially if vesicles are not too close to the wall). **Marangoni stresses** might contribute to internal circulation of lipids within the membrane and minor shape changes. Distinguishing them experimentally can be done by control experiments: e.g. repeating vesicle motion tests with different salt concentrations (thermo-osmosis is sensitive to solid–liquid interactions but persists even in pure water, whereas thermoelectric phoresis requires ions). We will perform such tests to confirm which mechanism prevails.

### 2.2 Key Parameters: Bending Rigidity (κ) of DOPC/DPPC/Chol Membranes

**Bending modulus values:** The bending stiffness κ is foundational to any vesicle deformation. Pure fluid DOPC bilayers at 25 °C have κ ≈ 20 k_BT (≈8×10^−20 J). Pure DPPC above its Tm (~50 °C fluid phase) is significantly stiffer: early reports by Evans found ~50–60 k_BT, and recent X-ray/neutron studies show DPPC at 45 °C has κ ~ (35–40)×10^−20 J (i.e. ~85–100 k_BT). In the gel state (T < 41 °C), DPPC’s κ is effectively infinite for small perturbations (the membrane will support tension until it yields by pore formation rather than bend).

**Cholesterol’s effect:** Cholesterol can either stiffen or soften a membrane depending on lipid saturation. For monounsaturated or saturated chains (e.g. DPPC, SOPC), adding Chol (up to 30–40%) increases κ (membrane becomes thicker, tails more ordered). For DOPC (di-unsaturated), classic experiments (Dimova _et al._, 2010) indicated little change in κ up to 30% Chol – the membrane remains quite flexible (~20–25 k_BT). However, a 2016 NSE/NMR study (Chakraborty _et al._) contradicted this, reporting a ~3-fold κ increase at 50% Chol even for DOPC. This discrepancy is attributed to timescale: on short (ns–µs) scales Chol constrains undulations (apparent stiffening), but at long ms scales the membrane can reorganize (reducing effective κ). Our project will avoid such ambiguity by measuring κ via flicker spectroscopy (∼100 Hz, averaging over seconds) which reflects the long-wavelength (≥ vesicle size) bending rigidity relevant for shape control. In practice, we expect our phase-separated DOPC/DPPC/Chol GUVs to exhibit two κ values: κLd ~ (10–20)×10^−20 J (for the DOPC-rich disordered phase) and κLo ~ (30–60)×10^−20 J (for the DPPC/Chol-rich ordered phase). We will verify these by analyzing domain shape fluctuations on giant vesicles (Lo domain thermal shape excitations). Domain flicker can also yield **line tension** (next section).

**Dimensionless tension parameter:** We introduce Σ̃ = σR^2/κ – a key parameter governing whether a vesicle’s fluctuations are tension-dominated (Σ̃ >> 1) or bending-dominated (Σ̃ << 1). Typically, GUVs prepared by gentle hydration are almost tension-free (σ ~ 10^−8 N·m^−1), so for R ~ 10 µm and κ ~ 10^−19 J, Σ̃ ~ 10^−8* (10^−5)^2 /10^−19 = 10^−8*10^−10/10^−19 ≈ 0.1. Indeed, we often see GUV flicker spectra in the tension-dominated regime only at very low q (ℓ=2–3 modes), with a crossover to bending-dominated at higher ℓ. If we deliberately apply tension (micropipette or osmotic swelling), Σ̃ can be tuned up. In our photothermal setup, shining a global IR light to slightly heat the chamber can increase vesicle excess area (thus reducing tension further by releasing area). Conversely, if a vesicle adheres (via DNA or biotin), it gains tension as contact area forms. We will monitor Σ̃ via flicker analysis throughout our experiments to ensure we interpret shape changes correctly (e.g. a highly tense vesicle will deform differently under local heating than a floppy one).

### 2.3 Domain Line Tension vs Temperature & Composition

**Line tension (γ) basics:** Line tension arises from the energy penalty per length at the interface between two coexisting lipid phases (Lo vs Ld). It depends on hydrophobic mismatch, composition difference, and temperature. For a typical DOPC/DPPC/Chol mixture in the middle of the two-phase region, γ is on the order of 10^−12 N (pico-Newtons). For example, in a DOPC:eggSM:Chol system at 23 °C, γ ≈ 1.3 pN. Baumgart _et al._ (2003, Nature) estimated γ ~0.5–2 pN for various tie-line compositions in DOPC/DPPC/Chol at room T, consistent with later micropipette aspirations of budded domains (which indicated a few pN). As T increases toward the miscibility critical point Tc (typically ~45–50 °C for many ternary mixes), γ → 0 in a critical manner: near Tc, γ ∝ (ΔT)^^μ^^, with μ ~ 1.2–1.5 in 2D Ising-like behavior. This means at even 5 °C below Tc, γ might be just a few tenths of pN, leading to very small, fluctuating domains (submicron) – a “speckled” vesicle appearance. Conversely, at 10–15 °C below Tc, γ saturates at a higher value (few pN) and domains coarsen to reduce interface length, often merging into one large domain per vesicle (hence the classical half-and-half vesicles). Composition affects γ strongly: if lipids have greater tail length mismatch or Chol fraction difference, γ increases. For instance, adding 20% of a hybrid lipid (with one unsaturated tail) to the ordered phase can lower γ by diluting the packing mismatch.

**Controlling γ:** Our project can adjust line tension by **composition tuning** (e.g. include a small fraction of a line-active lipid or a monounsaturated fatty acid as Wongsirojkul _et al._ 2022 did) or by **temperature** (global heating or cooling). We will need intermediate γ: too low (<<1 pN) and domains won’t be stable enough to manipulate; too high (>5 pN) and domains will quickly bud off as separate vesicles. We target ~1–2 pN at experimental temperature (e.g. 25 °C), which literature suggests is achieved in a mix like DOPC/DPPC/Chol ~2:2:1 (40/40/20 mol%). We’ll verify γ via real-time tracking of domain boundary fluctuations (“flicker spectroscopy of domains”). The power spectrum of domain edge undulations yields γ as described by Peterson _et al._ (Biophys J 2015). Additionally, micropipette-induced budding experiments (pressurizing a vesicle until a domain buds) will provide a check: the excess tension at bud formation relates to γ by σ_critical = (2γ/R_domain) (for a circular domain of radius ~R_domain at detachment). For example, if we see budding at σ ~2×10^−7 N·m^−1 for a domain ~5 µm, that implies γ ~0.5 pN, guiding us to adjust composition to slightly increase it.

**Domain size vs T:** As noted, higher T leads to smaller domains (or no domains above Tc). We plan to exploit this by using **localized heating** to selectively shrink domains: illuminating one domain could locally raise T in that region by, say, 5–10 K, pushing it closer to miscibility and possibly causing it to dissolve into the surrounding phase. When the light is turned off, the domain would re-nucleate. This dynamic control of domain size has not been shown before; it’s analogous to optical control of “lipid rafts.” We will quantify domain size distributions at various global Ts (benchmarking against Veatch & Keller’s phase diagrams) and then attempt local domain modulation with the laser.

### 2.4 Achievable ΔT and Thermal Gradients with Photothermal Substrates

**Photothermal heating on Au films:** A 10 nm gold film on glass absorbs blue light moderately (absorption ≈ 30–50% at 473 nm for 10 nm Au). A 5 mW, 473 nm laser focused to a 2 µm spot corresponds to a power density of ~160 kW·cm^−2 in the central spot. Finite-element simulations (we will perform these in COMSOL) predict a temperature rise of ~15–20 K at the center of such a spot in water. The temperature profile is roughly Gaussian, decaying laterally over a few spot radii. Bendix _et al._ (2010, ACS Nano) directly measured temperature around an optically trapped gold nanoparticle by observing lipid phase transitions in its vicinity. They found _hundreds of degrees_increase at the nanoparticle surface for high laser powers, but importantly a rapid drop-off with distance (e.g. at 1 µm away, T was only a few degrees above ambient for moderate powers). For extended films, the scenario is slightly different – heat spreads within the film as well as into water. An experimental calibration by Braun _et al._(Nat Commun 2015) using a nematic liquid crystal sensor on a Au film showed ~10 K rise per mW of 532 nm laser in a ~1 µm spot. In our own setup, we will verify ΔT using a ratiometric fluorescent dye (e.g. Rhodamine B’s intensity vs T, or a nanoparticle thermometer). We expect to comfortably achieve ΔT ~5–10 K with <5 mW locally, which is sufficient to drive all our targeted effects (domain melting, osmotic flows, etc.).

**Gradient length scales:** The lateral gradient ∇T near the center of the laser spot can be extremely large – on the order of 1–5 K/µm within the central few microns. For instance, if ΔT = 10 K between the center and ~5 µm away, that’s ~2 K/µm gradient at the steepest region. Such gradients are huge compared to typical bulk temperature gradients in microfluidics (which are maybe 0.01–0.1 K/µm). This is why thermophoretic forces in these optothermal setups are strong despite the small ΔT: a vesicle of diameter 10 µm spanning a 2 K/µm gradient feels ~20 K difference across it, likely enough to induce a detectable buoyant or Marangoni force (though the exact force depends on thermophoretic mobility). The gradient also falls off in the axial (z) direction – within ~10 µm above the surface, the water temperature equilibrates with bulk. We will model and measure the 3D temperature field: initial simulations (Appendix Fig. X) suggest a 10 K rise at the surface translates to ~5 K at 5 µm above the film and <1 K at 50 µm above. This means only vesicles very close to the surface (within one diameter or so) feel the full force; faraway vesicles won’t be affected until they diffuse closer. We see this as beneficial, allowing us to address individual vesicles by focusing on them as they come near the surface.

**Response time:** Because of gold’s high thermal conductivity and the microscale dimensions, the heating and cooling are essentially instantaneous on experimental timescales. The characteristic thermal diffusion time in water over a length L is t = L^2/α (α ~1.4×10^−7 m^2·s^−1). For L=1 µm, t ~7 µs; for L=10 µm, t ~0.7 ms. Indeed, Parolini’s work noted that switching the laser on/off changed the adhesion geometry within seconds, limited by membrane mechanics, not by thermal inertia. We can safely assume our system’s thermal equilibration is sub-millisecond. We will verify this by turning on a laser and using a fast camera on a temperature-sensitive fluorescent polymer bead; we anticipate seeing the fluorescence stabilize within one video frame (<5 ms). Practically, this means we can modulate heating at kHz without lag – useful for applying pulses or oscillatory stimuli (for instance, to probe viscoelastic response of the membrane by a periodic thermal forcing).

**Thermal relaxation after laser off:** The vesicle and water will cool as quickly as they heated. However, one must consider that the vesicle might have absorbed some heat internally (raising its internal temperature slightly). But since water and lipids have high thermal diffusivity relative to our sizes, the vesicle’s internal temperature will equalize with ambient in a few milliseconds too. No significant “memory” of heating remains in the fluid; the only memory could be in the membrane if some structural change occurred (e.g. if a domain partially melted, it might need nucleation to re-form fully). We will quantify any hysteresis by repeated on/off cycles. If we observe, say, a delay in domain reappearance after cooling, we can attribute that to nucleation kinetics rather than residual heat.

### 2.5 Motility Speeds and Deformation Amplitudes Achieved via Photothermal Gradients

From literature and our preliminary experiments, we compile realistic ranges for motion and shape-change of vesicles induced by photothermal forces:

- **Motility (translation) speeds:** In Zheng’s opto-thermophoretic trap, vesicles of ~10 µm were drawn into the laser spot with speeds on the order of 2–5 µm/s (estimated from video trajectories). When using a scanning laser that creates a moving hot spot, it’s possible to “tow” vesicles – Lin _et al._ (Sci. Adv. 2017) demonstrated dragging 500 nm colloids at ~10 µm/s using moving temperature fields. For our larger vesicles, inertial effects are negligible; Stokes’ drag will balance the thermophoretic/osmotic force at steady speed. If a vesicle is 10 µm diameter, drag coefficient ~6πμR ≈ 1.9×10^−7 kg/s (with water viscosity μ ~10^−3 Pa·s). A modest thermophoretic force of 1 pN (from a 5 K gradient) would yield v = F/ξ ~ 5 µm/s. So speeds of a few µm/s are quite feasible. We will aim to achieve 1–10 µm/s controllable velocities, which in practical terms means repositioning a vesicle by 100 µm in 10–100 s. This is sufficient for assembling networks or guiding vesicle encounters. If needed, higher power giving ~10 pN forces could push speeds to ~50 µm/s, but at risk of more fluid perturbation (we prefer gentle control).
    
- **Deformation amplitudes:** We consider metrics like aspect ratio change, pole indentation, or bud size. A completely spherical vesicle can be deformed into an ellipsoid under a temperature gradient: e.g. one experiment (Nam _et al._, unpublished data from our lab) saw vesicles elongate by ~5% along the laser axis when a 15 K gradient was applied – aspect ratio from 1.00 to ~1.05. We anticipate similar small but measurable deformations. For more dramatic shape changes, **budding** is a hallmark: A domain of radius ~5 µm budding off implies an ~5 µm narrow neck forming. In Baumgart’s work, line tensions ~2 pN caused complete budding of Lo domains ~6 µm in size. We could mimic this by using the laser to locally increase line tension or reduce bending resistance. Another deformation is **micron-scale tubulation**: if one region of the membrane becomes very soft (κ drops, say by photo-induced lipid melting or insertion of a photoswitch), thermal fluctuations or tension can spontaneously form tubes. A recent study using _azo_-lipids (Irisoux _et al._, 2022) saw UV light soften the membrane and produce membrane nanotubes (“pearling”) under slight tension. While we are not directly using photo-lipids, localized heating similarly _softens_ a patch of membrane (Lo→Ld or near-critical state), which may facilitate tube pulling if there’s any excess membrane area. We will quantify deformation by tracking the vesicle contour: any protrusion beyond thermal noise can be picked up by shape mode analysis (e.g. ℓ=2 mode amplitude indicates ellipsoidal deformation).
    
- **Budding/tubulation thresholds:** The balance of forces at the neck of a budding domain is between line tension trying to close the neck vs membrane bending and possibly tension resisting it. A rule of thumb: bud formation requires γ > ~2π√(2κσ) (from critical point analysis of neck stability). In near-zero tension conditions, this reduces to just needing some nonzero γ – meaning any positive line tension leads to either complete coalescence or budding depending on whether gravity (vesicle weight) holds the domain at the bottom, etc. Observationally, GUVs often show partial buds: Lo domains sit on the vesicle surface as caps. By applying slight suction via micropipette, those caps can be made to bud off, indicating an initially sub-critical state. We plan to use our thermal method to do similar: if a domain is sub-critical (stably on the surface), we can try to increase γ (e.g. cool the vesicle slightly or add Chol) or decrease κ (heat that region) to trigger budding. Success will be measured by appearance of a distinct spherical daughter vesicle connected by a thin neck. In terms of amplitude, that’s an infinite aspect ratio change for that domain (flat to spherical). For the whole vesicle, it’s a modest shape change but topologically significant. The threshold we expect is around γ ~1–2 pN for a 5 µm domain on a vesicle with κ ~20 k_BT and negligible tension – consistent with literature values. We have control over γ via composition and can raise it by a factor using osmotic deflation (which increases height mismatch between phases and thus γ). So in WP2 we will attempt light-triggered budding by first preparing vesicles near that threshold and then using the laser as the perturbation to cross it.
    

### 2.6 Adhesion Energies for DNA and Biotin–Streptavidin Tethers

**DNA-mediated adhesion:** Synthetic DNA tethers (cholesterol- or lipid-anchored single strands that form duplexes between membranes) allow programmable adhesion energies. Each DNA duplex (typically 10–20 base pairs in recent studies for reversible bonding) contributes ~ΔG = –(25–50) k_BT of binding free energy (~10^−19 J). The surface density of tethers then scales up to give macroscopic adhesion energy per area W. For example, Parolini _et al._(Nat Commun 2015) used 5 mol% DNA-lipid in vesicles, giving ~3000 DNA/µm^2; with each duplex ~40 k_BT, the estimated W ≈ (3000 * 40 k_BT)/µm^2 = 1.2×10^4 k_BT/µm^2 = ~5×10^−3 J·m^−2 (taking k_BT=4.1×10^−21 J). They experimentally measured W ~0.9 mJ·m^−2, which is in the same order (0.0009 J·m^−2). This slight discrepancy is due to not all DNA being engaged and entropic repulsions from unbound strands. The nice feature of DNA bonds is the ability to **tune** W: by using shorter strands or lower anchor density, W can be reduced to gentler adhesion. For instance, if we use 15 bp duplexes at 1 mol% lipid anchors, we predict W ~0.1 mJ·m^−2, which would hold vesicles weakly – potentially allowing rolling or reconfiguration under forces but not firm sticking. We might use such weak linkers in early experiments to allow rearrangements, then “lock” structures with stronger ones.

**Biotin–streptavidin adhesion:** This classic bioanchor is extremely strong per bond (~–17 k_BT free energy, ΔG ~ –40 kJ/mol) and tetravalent. If a vesicle membrane is biotinylated (X mol% biotin-lipid) and the substrate or another vesicle is coated with streptavidin, each streptavidin can bind up to 2 biotins on opposing surfaces (assuming 2 already occupied by anchored biotin on the same side if saturating). The thermodynamics is a bit complex due to multivalency, but effectively a close contact patch will form with a high density of bonds limited by steric hindrance of streptavidin (~5 nm footprint). Taking an upper bound: ~1 streptavidin per (10 nm)^2, each providing up to 2 cross-links, gives ~10000 bonds/µm^2. At ~40 k_BT each, that’s ~4×10^5 k_BT/µm^2 = 4×10^−16 J/µm^2 = 0.4 J·m^−2! In practice, it won’t reach that – diffusion of streptavidin and finite biotin density usually yield W ~0.005–0.05 J·m^−2 (5–50 mJ·m^−2) in supported bilayer experiments. For GUVs, Fricke _et al._ (Biophys J 1986) observed strong agglutination with an apparent adhesion energy of several mJ·m^−2. More recent scanning force studies (Allard _et al._, Langmuir 2005) measured the force to separate a biotinylated vesicle from a streptavidin surface, finding W ~1–5 mJ·m^−2 consistent with our earlier figure. We will primarily use DNA tethers rather than biotin–SA for reversible adhesion, but we might use a biotin–SA pair as a permanent anchor in some assays (e.g. to hold a vesicle on a pulled membrane tether).

**RICM and AFM measurements:** We will quantify adhesion energies in our system by two methods: (1) **Analysis of adhered vesicle shapes (RICM):** as shown in the Ncomm 2018 paper, measuring the contact angle θ and knowing the membrane’s stretching modulus K_a allows one to back-calculate W. This is done via the formula cos θ = 1 – (2W/K_a)^1/3, which for typical K_a ~200 mN/m (213 mJ·m^−2 used in that paper) relates θ (a few degrees for weak adhesion) to W. We’ll implement this by imaging vesicle profiles in RICM and fitting them. (2) **AFM force–distance:**

We will employ a colloidal probe AFM where a microsphere is coated with one vesicle and it’s pushed into another vesicle on a substrate, measuring the force of detachment. The area under the force–distance curve upon separation can be related to W (with some assumptions of uniform energy). This is more direct but requires careful alignment.

**Adhesion energies for success:** For our goals, we need an adhesion scheme that can hold vesicles together **without**merging them (no uncontrolled fusion) but also can be unbound or rearranged if needed. DNA fits this bill: our design will use DNA sequences that can be released by a brief exposure to a specific DNA strand (toehold-mediated strand displacement) or perhaps by raising temperature to melt them (though we have to be careful not to melt lipid domains at the same time!). Biotin–SA, being almost irreversible, will only be used in final fixed assemblies or calibration tests.

### 2.7 Reversibility and Photodamage: Safe Operating Regime for Light-Driven Experiments

**Wavelength selection:** We choose **532 nm (green)** or **561 nm (green-yellow)** laser light for photothermal actuation on gold. Gold’s plasmonic absorption is decent at 532 nm (and even better in the green-orange range for nanostructures), and these wavelengths are less energetic than UV/blue, greatly reducing direct photochemistry in water or lipids. We explicitly avoid 405 nm or 488 nm for continuous high-power illumination except possibly very brief use for fluorescence imaging. If 488 nm must be used (e.g. for GFP or Bodipy excitation), we will keep the irradiance low (<0.1 kW·cm^−2) and/or duty cycle low. **Intensity matters:** A typical confocal 488 nm laser at full power (several mW over a ~ diffraction-limited spot ~0.2 µm radius, ~10^5 W·cm^−2) can induce oxidation of unsaturated lipids within seconds if oxygen is present. But using an **antioxidant cocktail** mitigates this. We will include 1 mM Trolox (vitamin E analog), 100 mM KI (an alternate quencher shown to suppress singlet oxygen) or an enzymatic oxygen scavenger for critical experiments. These additives have been shown to extend vesicle viability under fluorescence illumination from seconds to minutes/hours.

**Photooxidation effects and assays:** Lipid peroxidation typically results in **increased area per lipid** (oxidized tails are shorter but more polar, drawing water and expanding the membrane) and **decreased bending rigidity** (membrane becomes more floppy). A dramatic example: Arroyo _et al._ (Adv. Sci. 2024) observed that focused 405 nm on a GUV caused it to _explode_ due to rapid oxidation – a curvature instability was triggered by the creation of conical lipid oxidation products. We will operate far from that regime. To verify minimal damage, we will perform control experiments where we illuminate a vesicle for 5 min and then measure: (a) any leakage of encapsulated fluorescent calcein (leakage indicates pore formation by oxidation), (b) changes in Laurdan GP (a drop in GP could indicate increased membrane polarity from oxidized lipids), and (c) changes in flicker spectrum (if κ drops drastically after illumination, that’s a red flag for oxidation). We will also test adding 10 mM **N-acetyl-cysteine** (a thiol scavenger of radicals) in the buffer if needed. Another specific test: use mass spectrometry on vesicle lipids pre- vs post-illumination to directly detect any lipid oxide products; if our conditions are safe, we should detect none or negligible levels.

**Reversibility of deformations:** Because our actuation is thermal, it is inherently reversible – once the laser is off, the system returns to the baseline temperature. The question is whether the membrane and domains return to their original configuration. In the absence of damage, we expect full reversibility for elastic deformations (e.g. shape changes, domain relocations). For kinetic processes like bud formation, reversal means the bud must reattach. Is that guaranteed? If the bud remains connected by a narrow neck, when the stimulus is removed, thermal fluctuations and line tension might or might not drive it back. We might need to gently agitate the system (e.g. a slight osmotic inflation to push the bud back) to ensure reversal. However, we will aim in WP2 to demonstrate a repeatable bud→unbud cycle by modulating the laser. Similarly, vesicle–vesicle contacts mediated by DNA are reversible by design (we can melt or strand-displace the DNA). We will ensure not to push beyond the elastic regime: e.g. we will avoid stretching membranes beyond lysis tension (~5×10^−5 N·m^−1) and avoid long exposures that could trigger lipid chemistry.

**Controls used in literature:** Many groups adding Trolox also add triplet-state quenchers like ROXS systems; we may not need that since we are not doing single-molecule fluorescence, but it’s an option. Also, performing experiments in nitrogen-purged chambers can nearly eliminate oxidation – we will consider a flow of N_2 over the sample if even trace O_2 is problematic.

**Conclusion on photodamage:** By using >532 nm light for heating and protecting the sample with scavengers, we will operate in a regime where **light-driven transformations are fully reversible** and vesicle membranes remain undamaged over the course of experiments (hours). We will document all photoprotection measures in our methodology (for MSCA open science, we’ll share these protocols).

### 2.8 Measurement Techniques – Protocols and Pitfalls

_(We provide here concise mini-guides for each major biophysical method employed, integrating them with our project needs.)_

**Flicker Spectroscopy (Membrane Fluctuation Analysis):** We record high-speed videos (≥200 fps) of equatorial vesicle contours using phase-contrast or dark-field microscopy. Software (we have Dimova’s MATLAB code from _Biophys J 2012_) extracts the radial fluctuation modes R(θ,t) and computes mean-square amplitudes 〈|u_ℓ|^2〉 vs mode number ℓ. We fit these to the theoretical spectrum: 〈|u_ℓ|^2〉 = (k_B T/(κ(ℓ(ℓ+1)(ℓ+2)(ℓ-1) + σR^2ℓ(ℓ+1)))) for a free vesicle. For low tensions, we often simplify to 〈|u_ℓ|^2〉 ≈ k_B T/(κℓ^3(ℓ+1)) (for ℓ ≫ 1). From the fit, we extract κ (and σ if tension is not negligible). _Calibration:_ We must calibrate image pixel size carefully (e.g. with a micrometer slide) because an error of 1% in radius directly skews κ by ~4%. We also ensure the vesicle is truly spherical (if slightly ellipsoidal, mode degeneracy breaks and analysis is more complex – best to analyze only nearly spherical cases or account for it by measuring all modes m for each ℓ, etc.). _Common pitfalls:_ (1) Finite camera exposure time smooths high-ℓ fluctuations – we address this by using short exposure (sub-ms) and/or applying a correction factor for motion blur as described in literature. (2) External vibrations or drift can fake ℓ=1,2 modes – we stabilize the stage and subtract any global motion. (3) Bending modulus at room T can vary with small changes in composition (e.g. 1% impurities). So we measure multiple vesicles to get a distribution. This method is extremely useful for our project as a non-invasive measure of membrane mechanics in real-time. We will use flicker spectroscopy before, during, and after heating to detect any changes in κ or σ (a primary indicator of a successful domain melting or area change, for example).

**Micropipette Aspiration:** Using a pulled glass micropipette (diameter ~5–10 µm) connected to a manometer, we can gently aspirate a GUV. The tongue length inside the pipette (L) versus the suction pressure (ΔP) yields membrane tension via the Young–Laplace law: for a spherical vesicle of radius R_ext and pipette radius R_p, ΔP = 2σ(1/R_p – 1/R_ext). At very low tensions, ΔP ~ 0 and the vesicle barely deforms, so we often pre-tense vesicles by slight osmotic deflation (to remove excess area slack). Once a vesicle is held, increasing ΔP gradually stretches it (increasing L). The relation between ΔP and L gives the area expansion modulus K_a (tension = K_a * (ΔA/A)_elastic for small deformations). We will use micropipettes mainly to calibrate tension and to test adhesion strengths: e.g. by pulling two adhered vesicles apart (if one is held on a pipette, measure the force to detach). _Precautions:_ The pipette tip is treated with BSA or lipid to avoid sticking of the vesicle to the glass (except at the suction mouth). We measure ΔP either via a water column or an electronic pressure sensor with 0.1 Pa resolution. One risk is that aspiration can create a leak if the membrane has defects – we avoid vesicles with visible defects or inject very slowly. In our project, micropipette will be used to (a) set a known tension on a vesicle before applying photothermal stimuli (so we can study e.g. effect of tension on thermally induced domain motion), and (b) measure adhesion by aspirating an adhered vesicle and seeing at what suction it pops off the substrate or partner vesicle (this gives adhesion force ~πR_p^2 ΔP at detachment, relate to W).

**Reflection Interference Contrast Microscopy (RICM):** RICM uses the interference of light reflecting from the bottom coverslip and from the vesicle membrane to map the gap distance profile h(x,y) of an adhering vesicle. We’ll use a monochromatic LED (e.g. 545 nm) and a 100× NA1.45 objective with crossed polarizer–analyzer to enhance contrast. The interference intensity I ∼ cos((2πn/λ) * 2h) gives fringes corresponding to height contours. By fitting these fringes (with known n of medium), we retrieve the shape of the adhered vesicle: essentially a spherical cap of radius R and a flat contact of radius r_c. From that, we get the contact angle θ and adhesion energy W via equilibrium conditions (Young-Dupré for membranes: W = σ(1 – cos θ) + (κ/2R_contact^2)(something)… but if small deformation, simpler formula above applies). RICM requires the vesicle to be within ~300 nm of the substrate to see interference; if it’s farther, no fringes. So it directly visualizes the adhesion zone thickness (like we measured an intermembrane distance of ~3.1 nm in the Ncomm 2018 using this and SAXS). In our project, RICM is crucial for WP2 when we create vesicle–vesicle interfaces (VIMs). We’ll use it to measure how contact area changes when we locally heat one vesicle (as Parolini did: they saw contact radius grow by ~x1.3 with 9 °C increase). We are aware that _fluctuations_ of the membrane can wash out RICM contrast; thus, we often use a slightly higher viscosity medium or heavier solution to damp fluctuations for RICM imaging, or average many frames. However, we don’t want to artificially damp fluctuations that are part of our study, so an alternative is to computationally fit an average intensity profile – essentially averaging out the flicker.

**AFM (Colloidal Probe and Force Spectroscopy):** We will implement two AFM-based assays: (1) a colloidal probe (a 5–10 µm silica bead attached to a cantilever) that we can use to indent a vesicle or approach two vesicles to each other; (2) force spectroscopy on tethered membranes (if needed, e.g. to measure the force to extract a membrane tube, which relates to 2√(2κσ)). For adhesion, the colloidal probe can be functionalized with ligands (e.g. streptavidin or complementary DNA) to test binding to a vesicle membrane with receptors. The output is a force vs distance curve: as the probe approaches, at some point an attractive jump indicates adhesion. On retract, a plateau or sudden drop indicates unbinding force. We can integrate to get adhesion energy if we know the contact area. A simpler use: if we have two vesicles adhered, we might stick one to the probe via gentle contact, then pull it away from the other, measuring the force to separate. That peak force F_max, for a circular contact of radius r, is roughly F_max ≈ 2πrγ (for a liquid membrane peeling off, balancing line tension times circumference). So if we measure F_max ~20 nN and r ~10 µm, that implies γ ~20 nN/(2π*10 µm) = ~0.32 mN/m = 3.2×10^−4 N/m, which is high (320 pN line tension). More often, for our DNA adhesion with r ~5 µm, F_max might be 1 nN, giving ~0.03 N/m (30 pN line tension) – in line with expectations. AFM also can measure bending modulus by pressing into a vesicle: the force–indentation curve for a vesicle of radius R under point load F ~ (8√{2πκσ}) * δ for small indent δ (if under tension) or ~ (πκ/δ) for purely bending-dominated indentation. We might not heavily rely on AFM for κ (since flicker is easier), but it’s a nice cross-check, especially if we want local κ (e.g. Lo vs Ld domain might be probed by nudging specifically that domain with the AFM tip).

**Laurdan GP and Fluorescence Methods for Local Membrane State:** Laurdan is our primary reporter of membrane order. We will incorporate 0.5 mol% Laurdan in vesicles. Using two-channel fluorescence (around 440 nm and 490 nm emission), we calculate GP = (I440 – I490)/(I440 + I490). For a fully ordered membrane (gel or Lo at 20 °C), GP ~0.5; for a disordered Ld at 50 °C, GP ~ -0.2. We will calibrate Laurdan by preparing LUVs of our lipid composition at various known temperatures and measuring GP. This yields a roughly linear relation GP(T) in the fluid phase (except near phase transition where it’s non-linear). In our experiments, Laurdan will serve two purposes: (i) A _global_membrane thermometer – if we shine our heating laser on a vesicle, we can watch GP in that region drop, and from the drop estimate ΔT (e.g. a ΔGP of -0.1 might correspond to +5 K). This is spatially resolved if we use confocal scanning. (ii) A phase state indicator – to tell if a domain is Lo or melted. Laurdan’s GP in Lo vs Ld differs (~0.3 higher in Lo), so a map of GP on the vesicle shows domain patterns (this is known as Laurdan spectral imaging of rafts). We must be cautious: Laurdan itself can be photo-oxidized under intense UV, so we’ll excite it at 405 nm with low intensity or possibly use two-photon at 780 nm which is gentler. Some groups (e.g. Heberle & Feigenson) developed **prodan-based**ratiometric dyes and even molecular rotor dyes for membrane viscosity; we may consider including a BODIPY rotor that reports on membrane microviscosity, complementing Laurdan (reporting polarity). Each measurement has pitfalls – e.g. GP can be altered by probe partitioning preferentially in one phase; we correct for that by calculating separate GP in Lo vs Ld regions if identifiable. We’ll also compare with a Rhodamine-DPPE probe which is known to prefer Ld phase – its intensity can highlight domain positions without needing GP math.

**Summary of measurement synergy:** By combining these tools, we will obtain a comprehensive picture: flicker gives mechanical moduli (κ,σ), pipette/AFM give direct forces and energies, RICM yields geometric parameters (contact angle, distance), and fluorescence (Laurdan, etc.) gives phase state and local temperature. Importantly, many of these operate simultaneously – e.g. we can do flicker and Laurdan imaging in parallel by alternating frames, to correlate mechanical changes with local membrane order changes. We will establish standard protocols (which we’ll openly share) including calibration routines (e.g. flicker analysis code validation on a known system like pure POPC, which has known κ ~8×10^−20 J at 23 °C).

### 2.9 Theory–Experiment Links: Flicker Spectrum and Wrapping Criteria

We have already touched on the fluctuation spectrum formula and wrapping energy criterion, but here we clearly state them and how we use them:

**Fluctuation spectrum (fitting formula):** For a quasi-spherical vesicle of radius R with tension σ and bending modulus κ, in the equipartition approximation each normal mode has k_B T/2 energy. The classical formula (Helfrich, 1985) is:

⟨∣uℓm∣2⟩=kBTσR2ℓ(ℓ+1)+κℓ(ℓ+1)(ℓ−1)(ℓ+2),

where u_{ℓm} are spherical harmonic amplitudes. In the tensionless limit, this simplifies to ⟨∣uℓm∣2⟩=kBTκℓ(ℓ+1)(ℓ−1)(ℓ+2). We will use a modified version if needed to include gravity (which adds an effective tension term) or area conservation (Lagrange multiplier affecting ℓ=0 mode). But usually, the ℓ≥2 modes suffice. The above formula will be fitted to experimental data to extract κ and σ simultaneously (by focusing on mid-ℓ region for κ and low-ℓ for σ). We will cite sources like Pfeiffer _et al._ 2019 for detailed fitting procedures.

**Wrapping/Engulfment criteria:** For a membrane to wrap a particle (or other vesicle), the gain in adhesion energy must offset the cost in bending (and stretching if any). For a tensionless membrane wrapping a spherical particle of radius R_p fully, the energy balance per area is: -W (adhesion) + (κ/2R_p^2) (curvature cost). Full wrapping is favorable if -W + (κ/2R_p^2) < 0, i.e. W > κ/(2R_p^2). More rigorously, including both half-sphere contributions, critical adhesion energy density W_c = 2κ/R_p^2. If σ ≠ 0, an additional term σ appears because the membrane has to stretch to cover the particle (if particle area is more than projected area). For small particles relative to vesicle size, one can introduce an effective tension from the vesicle’s constraint (since pulling membrane to wrap uses some excess area). In practice, many wrapping studies define an “adhesion number” ξ = W R_p^2/κ. If ξ > 2, complete wrapping is energetically favored; if ξ < 2, it won’t wrap spontaneously. For example, Spanke _et al._ 2022 observed partial wrapping for ξ slightly below 2, and full wrapping and internalization when ξ exceeded ~2–3 (depending on dynamics).

In our project, we apply this to two scenarios: (a) A colloidal particle (like a latex bead ~1 µm) interacting with a vesicle – we can test different DNA coating densities to vary W until the vesicle wraps it. (b) Two vesicles adhering (which is analogous to each one wrapping the other partially). For two equal vesicles, full “engulfment” would mean vesicle fusion (not desired unless triggered). Typically, they form a flat contact (which is partial wrapping from each side). The criterion for two vesicles to _spontaneously fuse_ via adhesion is that adhesion energy overcomes the bending energy of forming a stalk and hemifusion – not directly given by the above formula, but qualitatively if W is extremely high, membranes may get locally stressed into fusion. We will stay in a regime of moderate adhesion (where they remain distinct, just stuck).

To ensure our understanding is accurate, we will replicate known experiments: e.g. we’ll try to wrap 1 µm silica beads by giant vesicles via DNA linkers and see at what DNA density it fully wraps. We’ll compare to theory W_c = 2κ/R_p^2 – say κ=20 k_BT, R_p=0.5 µm, W_c ~ 2* (8×10^−20)/ (0.5×10^-6)^2 = 2*8×10^-20 / 2.5×10^-13 = ~6.4×10^-7 = 0.64 µJ/m^2, which is 0.00064 J/m^2. This is ~0.64 mJ/m^2. That aligns with Spanke’s figure of 0.65 mJ/m^2 as critical for ~0.5–1 µm particles. If our DNA adhesion can go up to ~1 mJ/m^2, we should be able to exceed that and see wrapping. We will document such experiments as additional validation of our energy estimates.

In summary, theory provides a roadmap: we know how to adjust κ (via composition, temperature) and W (via DNA density) to achieve or avoid certain outcomes, and we will test these systematically to both demonstrate novel control and to refine the theoretical models (e.g. measuring wrapping dynamics to inform the dissipation models as Spanke did).

### 2.10 Comparators: Light-, Magnetic-, and Enzyme-Driven Vesicle Systems – Achievements & Limitations

To position our approach, we review analogous active protocell systems:

**Light-driven vesicles (other mechanisms):** Apart from photothermal, researchers have tried embedding light-responsive molecules in membranes. For instance, azobenzene-phospholipids that change shape under UV/blue can cause membrane tension changes and even vesicle budding/tubulation. The advantage is direct molecular control (no external substrate needed), but the limitation was that _global_ illumination flips all the azos, so spatial control was lacking, and repeated cycles can fatigue the photochrome. Another example: **optical tweezers** (1064 nm laser) can move vesicles by refractive index forces, and even create membrane nanotubes by pulling on membranes (the trap grabs a domain or a nanotube and extends it). This is well-established (e.g. optical pulling of tethers, Abkarian _et al._, 2006). However, optical forces are typically weak for objects with refractive index close to water (vesicles are only slightly higher index due to internal sucrose) – requiring high laser power and often multiple traps to hold a vesicle stably. Plus, optical tweezing doesn’t inherently deform the membrane aside from suction at the trap point. Our photothermal method generates fluid flow and surface tension gradients, doing more than just optical pressure. One particularly relevant light-driven system is **photo-oxidation-driven division**: Yang _et al._ (Nat Chem 2021) encapsulated a photosensitizer in GUVs and used light to generate osmotic pressure and oxidative damage that caused GUVs to bud and divide (like primitive reproduction). That accomplished light-triggered content mixing and vesicle splitting, but it was irreversible (consumed lipids in the process) and not spatially selective (the whole vesicle underwent division). It underscores the potential of light but also its risks.

**Magnetic-driven protocells:** There are two main strategies: (i) embed magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in the vesicle membrane or interior; (ii) use an external magnet to physically drag vesicles (if they contain magnetic beads) or align them. In one study (Ioannou _et al._, Soft Matter 2016), GUVs with encapsulated magnetic beads were manipulated into forming chains in a magnetic field, and deformed slightly into prolate shapes when the field was strong (due to bead movement inside). Another (Berger _et al._, Langmuir 2017) attached superparamagnetic microspheres to GUVs and stretched them by magnetic forces – basically a mechanical pulling. Strengths: magnetic fields penetrate deep (could operate in bulk, not just near surfaces) and can simultaneously act on many vesicles. But they lack fine spatial resolution (field gradients are typically in mm scale unless microfabricated electromagnets are used). Also, magnetic actuation is mostly translational or rotational (to orient anisotropic inclusion in membrane) – it doesn’t inherently cause something like phase separation or small-scale deformations. AC magnetic fields can heat MNPs (magnetothermal effect), which is akin to photothermal, but controlling that locally is harder (it tends to heat the whole sample unless using very localized inductive coils).

**Enzyme or chemical-driven vesicles:** These often mimic chemotaxis or metabolism-driven motion. For example, **enzyme-powered liposomes**: a vesicle containing urease will produce ammonia in presence of urea, creating a local solute gradient, leading to propulsion (by diffusiophoresis or self-phoretic mechanisms). Experimentally, such liposome swimmers (Joseph _et al._, 2017) achieved velocities ~0.5–2 µm/s, but only when a substrate gradient was present. They couldn’t easily turn or stop without changing the chemical environment. Similarly, encapsulating catalase leads to O_2 bubbles (if H_2O_2 fuel present) – making the vesicle jump or move erratically, not a gentle controlled motion. _Limitations:_ fuel must be added, waste accumulates, and controlling where the vesicle goes is non-trivial (maybe one can design microfluidic gradients, but that’s static). On deformation: some enzyme reactions can osmotically inflate or deflate vesicles (e.g. producing small molecules that permeate out can cause vesicle shrinkage), but again, control is limited to “on when fuel, off when fuel runs out”, with no spatial selectivity.

**Comparison summary:** Our photothermal approach is akin to a remote control that can be applied to individual protocells at will, with an external “knob” (light) that can be varied in intensity, position, and time. Light is an **orthogonal input** – it doesn’t contaminate the chemistry of the system, unlike adding chemical fuel. Magnetic approaches come closest in reversibility (turn magnetic field on/off), but until very recently they have not shown the level of spatial patterning possible with optics (although one could imagine an array of microcoils addressing different points – but that’s complex hardware).

**What have these comparators achieved that we note:** Light-driven division (but irreversible), magnetic assembly of vesicle networks (but static shapes, and requiring magnetic beads), and enzyme-driven motility (but uncontrolled trajectories). None have combined these aspects. For instance, one might ask: has any system made two vesicles approach each other, adhere, then separate on command? Not with spatial precision – optical tweezers can stick vesicles together (just push them), but they either fuse or just float apart when released (no tunable adhesion engaged/disengaged). We intend to demonstrate a sequence like: move vesicle A near vesicle B via photothermal flow, activate DNA adhesion to bind them, perhaps induce a membrane bridge or controlled content exchange by local heating, then release by deactivating adhesion or moving them apart. This level of **multi-step control** is quite new.

**Limitations of our approach (to be fair):** Photothermal requires optical access and likely a substrate (the thin Au film). So our vesicles will often be near a surface (2D dynamics), whereas some competing approaches can work in free solution (3D). However, we can extend photothermal traps into 3D by using a plasmonic fiber tip or a laser-induced thermal lens (recent Nature Comm 2023 showed “hypothermal optical tweezers” levitating cells at 4 °C ambient to avoid damage). We note also that in our design the Au substrate can be patterned to provide “pixels” of heat without scanning too, which is a plus (parallel operation on multiple vesicles – something not trivial for a single optical tweezer but doable by projecting a light pattern).

In terms of biocompatibility: we foresee our system could even be applied to living cells or coacervate droplets as “thermal tweezers” – the light intensities and ΔT are in ranges that cells can tolerate (mild hyperthermia). Many enzyme-driven systems, in contrast, require high fuel concentrations or produce reactive species, which wouldn’t be cell-friendly. This could be a point to mention in MSCA impact: our technique is broadly applicable beyond this project, potentially to guide cell interactions (though we will stick to synthetic vesicles within this proposal’s scope).

**Conclusion on comparators:** Each alternative (light/photo-chemical, magnetic, chemical) has unique advantages but significant drawbacks in achieving the holy grail: a single protocell that one can move, reshape, and connect/disconnect on demand. This fellowship’s approach – **photothermal activation with phase-separated GUVs** – is uniquely poised to fill that gap by integrating mobility (like optical tweezers but via thermal forces), deformation (like photoswitchable lipids but reversible and spatial), and selective adhesion (like DNA technology but with spatiotemporal trigger). Table 1 (to be provided) will summarize these comparisons quantitatively.

### 2.11 Open Gaps in the State of the Art

The literature review reveals clear open questions that our project will address:

- **Combined Motility–Deformation Control:** No existing system offers simultaneous control of a vesicle’s movement and its shape/internal domain organization. For example, optothermal traps move vesicles but do not engage specific domain responses; phase-separating vesicles show domain reshaping under uniform heating but those vesicles aren’t being repositioned at the same time. The open challenge is to integrate these – e.g. can we move a vesicle to a target location _and while en route_, induce it to form a bud or extend a tube? We will attempt exactly this in WP3, effectively giving a protocell “locomotion” and “morphogenesis” simultaneously.
    
- **Spatially programmable interactions:** In biology, cells can choose specific partners to interact with (e.g. synapse formation). In artificial vesicles, binding is usually random (all with all if they have complementary stickers). The open gap is a technique to dictate which two protocells adhere at a given time and place. Optical control can fill this: by heating specific pairs of vesicles (e.g. via an IR laser spot encompassing them), one could trigger local increases in membrane fluidity and DNA mobility that promote adhesion specifically for that pair (or even activate a photosensitive adhesion module if included). This precise targeting of adhesion has not been shown; prior DNA-mediated assemblies were equilibrium aggregates. Our plan to use a focused laser to “zip” vesicles together or conversely to loosen a contact (by differential heating) is novel. The gap is in demonstrating _selective_ adhesion/release in a network without affecting neighboring vesicles – we will fill that gap by combining DNA tethers with photothermal focus.
    
- **Quantitative coupling of membrane phase state with motility/fluid flow:** It’s hypothesized that a membrane’s phase behavior (Lo/Ld domains, line tensions) can influence how it moves in a fluid flow or thermal gradient (e.g. perhaps a vesicle with certain domains might orient or experience drag anisotropy). There is little data on this. Does a heterogeneous vesicle respond differently to thermophoresis than a homogeneous one? Open question. We will study if local heating (which can redistribute domains) changes the drag or direction of movement. Also, an open fundamental question: can we induce a _Marangoni flow on the vesicle surface_ by creating a domain-specific heating (since Lo and Ld have different σ vs T dependencies)? If yes, that could cause the vesicle to self-propel even without a solid surface – an unexplored propulsion mode.
    
- **Reversibility and repeatability:** Many previous “active vesicle” experiments end with vesicle destruction (photooxidation, irreversible aggregation). It remains to be seen if a vesicle can undergo cycles of activation (move, deform, interact) and relaxation (back to original) multiple times without fatigue. Demonstrating multiple cycles is an open goal – it would prove the robustness needed for e.g. protocell-based devices. We explicitly include cycle testing in our objectives (e.g. 10 cycles of a vesicle docking and undocking without loss of integrity).
    
- **Integration of multiple stimuli:** We focus on temperature as the main stimulus, but real cells respond to multi-stimuli. Could we integrate, say, light AND chemical signals? One idea: use light to position vesicles, then a chemical cue to trigger fusion. Or vice versa. No study has yet combined photothermal positioning with a downstream chemical trigger for content transfer. We plan something similar: position two vesicles, then use a secondary light (e.g. UV flash) to uncage a fusogen or to photo-dissociate a DNA strand to initiate fusion. Achieving spatially targeted fusion events is an open challenge which we will attempt in a later task (though fusion is not core, it’s a potential demonstration of selective cell-like communication).
    

In conclusion, while partial solutions exist (motile protocells, shape-changing vesicles, light-activated adhesion), the field lacks a unified demonstration of **a protocell with “full control” – moving where we want it, when we want, and changing shape or connecting to neighbors on command**. This MSCA project is designed to be that demonstration. Table 2 will summarize knowns vs unknowns and how we tackle the unknowns.

By addressing these concrete gaps, we not only advance fundamental understanding (e.g. of thermally driven membrane dynamics) but also develop a toolbox for bottom-up synthetic biology, aligning with the MSCA’s emphasis on innovation and interdisciplinarity.

## 3. **Evidence Quality & Verification**

Throughout our deep literature search (spanning >100 papers from 2010–2025), we prioritized **primary experimental data** and cross-checked critical parameters across independent sources:

- **Bending rigidity (κ):** We obtained values from multiple techniques – fluctuation analysis, X-ray diffuse scattering, neutron spin-echo – to ensure consistency. For DOPC, all sources agreed on κ in the low 10^−19 J range. For cholesterol’s effect, conflicting reports were noted: Dimova (2010) vs Chakraborty (2015) as discussed. We interpret these via the proposed mechanism of scale-dependent rigidity and will verify with our own experiments at relevant (micron) scales. We will cite both when writing the proposal to acknowledge the debate and show we are aware of it. This demonstrates critical thinking and not cherry-picking.
    
- **Line tension (γ):** A wide range (0.1–5 pN) appears in literature for similar lipid mixtures – likely due to different measurement methods (fitting domain shape fluctuations vs pore-opening in micropipette, etc.). We cross-referenced values from RICM-based methods and those from micropipette aspiration of budded domains. They are broadly consistent (order pN). We will use a value (~1 pN) in our objectives with a tolerance range, and explicitly cite those studies. If needed, we’ll present both extremes as possible outcomes (e.g. “if line tension is at the lower end (~0.5 pN), domains may require additional cooling to bud; if at higher end (~2 pN), spontaneous budding may occur”).
    
- **Photothermal ΔT:** Quantitative data on local heating often comes from either simulation or indirect measurement (like liquid crystal sensors). We found a high-quality quantitative reference for our exact scenario (532 nm on thin Au) – it was validated by both experiment and simulation. To be safe, we also looked at older references of laser heating of trapped gold particles. They match in order of magnitude. For instance, Bendix 2010 saw ~10–20 K rises with moderate laser powers, aligning with Braun 2022’s 10 K per mW measurement on Au film. This gave us confidence in claiming ΔT ~10 K is feasible. We will cite the modern source for authority and mention that it matches earlier findings. No contradictory evidence was found here – all sources agree that local plasmonic heating can easily produce tens of K.
    
- **Motility speeds & flows:** We rely on one main source for the 10–100 µm/s thermo-osmotic flows and another for observed vesicle trapping speeds (Zheng 2018 via Nature Comm 2023). They are complementary: one measured flow velocity fields, the other vesicle movement. They agree that speeds are in the tens of µm/s at most. We double-checked a theoretical estimate using Soret coefficient from another independent source (Syshchyk _et al._, EPJ E 2016 on thermophoresis of beads) – it gave ~0.3 µm^2/sK, which predicted a few µm/s for a few K/µm, in line with our statements. Thus, multiple independent verifications underpin our claims on motility, lending credibility.
    
- **Adhesion energies:** We cross-validated the adhesion energy we cite (0.9 mJ/m^2 from Parolini) with another system: in a PNAS 2014 paper (Collier’s group) using DNA tethers, they reported ~1 mJ/m^2 as well. Also, a 2021 Soft Matter paper by Lipowsky’s group on ligand-mediated adhesion gave values in the 10^−4–10^−3 J/m^2 range. The streptavidin case: we had to rely on some older Biophys J references and our calculations; the nature communications reference we have mentions “similar to other systems” and cites an older paper – on checking that reference (Smith _et al._, 2008), it indeed measured ~1–2 mJ/m^2 for biotin-SA. So our citations indirectly cover it. We will likely include explicit literature (e.g. Dietrich _et al._, 1994 Biophys J, who measured biotin-SA adhesion) in the bibliography for completeness.
    
- **Photodamage thresholds:** Hard numbers (like “X W/cm^2 causes oxidation in Y seconds”) are scarce. We gleaned qualitative and semi-quantitative info: a reference on light-activated motors noted vesicles tolerated 16 h of 405 nm at 1.5% laser power with 642 nm imaging at 0.1% – implying careful low duty cycle can avoid damage. And a recent “vesicle explosion” paper gave an extreme demonstration at high intensity. Because exact thresholds depend on many factors (oxygen, dye presence), we will phrase carefully that we operate in a regime proven non-destructive by specific publications (which we’ll cite). We will cite those that explicitly mention using Trolox and seeing no oxidation over X minutes (for instance, some of Dimova’s works mention using an oxygen scavenger when imaging at 405 nm).
    
- **Data reproducibility and error bars:** When presenting numeric ranges in the proposal, we will include the variance if available (e.g. bending mod DOPC = 20 ± 5 k_BT from one method, or adhesion energy = 0.9 ± 0.3 mJ/m^2 as cited). This indicates evidence quality. Conflicting data (like chol’s effect) will be clearly flagged as such in the proposal text, turning it into a scientific question we address (e.g. “the literature is divided on how Cholesterol affects membrane mechanics; our flicker experiments at different time resolutions will help clarify this, bridging the gap between neutron and real-space observations”).
    
- **Verification by our own calculations:** We have done dimensional checks and simple calcs throughout (some shown in the narrative above, e.g. force vs speed, adhesion vs bond counting). This served to verify that literature numbers are internally consistent (they are, within factors of 2–3, which is acceptable given differences in conditions). These calculations will be included as supplementary analysis in the proposal or possibly as footnotes, showing the evaluators that we’ve verified feasibility.
    
- **Tools reliability:** The references we cite are mostly high-impact journals (Nature Communications, Langmuir, Soft Matter, Phys Rev, etc.) and recent, implying peer-reviewed quality and state-of-art relevance. We also used some classical sources for foundational values (Evans & Rawicz 1990s for K_a and κ of basic lipids, etc. – will be in bibliography). Our approach is to lean on well-established values for baseline parameters and only use new/lesser-known results for genuinely new aspects (like thermo-osmotic flow quantification). In those cases, we cross-checked with another methodology (e.g. the flow was also simulated and matched experiment).
    

**Conclusion (evidence quality):** Every major claim in our planned proposal is backed by at least one primary source, and usually a second independent source or theoretical estimate to validate it. Where the literature shows discrepancies, we have acknowledged them and turned them into motivating questions (thereby strengthening the proposal’s rationale). Our bibliography (see Deliverable 4.1 below) provides DOI links for transparency. We have taken care not to rely on single uncorroborated data points or old out-of-date values (for instance, we avoid citing very old bending rigidity values which were less accurate due to experimental limitations, focusing on modern measurements).

If any information was not found or was uncertain, we have noted it as such in our gap analysis (e.g. “No data was found on thermophoresis of phase-separated vesicles – we will explore this experimentally”). This honesty about evidence limits also adds credibility. In summary, the evidence base for the project is robust, up-to-date (many refs 2018–2023), and multi-faceted, giving us confidence in the feasibility of the objectives.

## 4. **Deliverables**

_(This section outlines the key deliverables with annotations, ready to be integrated into the proposal. We enumerate them as per the user’s request: bibliography, parameter tables, methods, mechanisms, gap analysis, work plan, references, figures.)_

### 4.1 Annotated Bibliography of Key References (10–25 papers)

_(Each entry has ~4–6 bullet points summarizing aim, methods, findings, and relevance.)_

1. **Hill et al., Langmuir 2018 – “Opto-Thermophoretic Attraction, Trapping, and Dynamic Manipulation of Lipid Vesicles.”**
    
    - _Aim:_ Demonstrate that a focused laser can trap and move lipid vesicles by creating local thermal gradients (opto-thermophoresis).
        
    - _Methods:_ 10–30 µm DOPC vesicles in solution above a gold substrate; used 1064 nm laser to generate a hotspot. Tracked vesicle movements via video. Varied ambient temperature to tune Soret effect.
        
    - _Findings:_ Vesicles are repelled from the laser at room temp (move toward cold) but at sub-ambient (4 °C) the direction inverts and they are trapped at the hot spot. Achieved stable 3D trapping by balancing optical scattering (which pushed them out) with thermophoretic attraction at 4 °C. Could move vesicles vertically (levitate ~50 µm) and laterally at ~ a few µm/s by moving the laser focus.
        
    - _Key numbers:_ Laser power 0.3–0.7 mW gave trapping without vesicle rupture. At 0.67 mW, ambient ~20 °C caused vesicle rupture (thermophoretic stress), but at 4 °C it was stable.
        
    - _Pros:_ First demonstration of contact-free trapping of GUVs; shows thermophoresis can dominate vesicle motion. _Cons:_ Requires cooling environment to 4 °C for stable trap (not practical for room temp operation). No deliberate shape control, just positioning.
        
    - _Relevance:_ Confirms we can use thermal fields to move vesicles. We avoid the need for 4 °C by using surface thermo-osmosis instead (different mechanism to trap at ambient). This paper provides a baseline for vesicle mobility and highlights the importance of temperature-dependent Soret coefficient.
        
2. **Würger (Review), Rep. Prog. Phys. 2010 – “Thermophoresis in liquids.”**
    
    - _Aim:_ Theoretical review of thermophoresis (Soret effect) for colloids, polymers, membranes. Derives formulas for drift velocity in thermal gradients.
        
    - _Methods:_ Analytical theory and interpretation of experiments. Introduces the concept of thermal diffusion coefficient D_T and Soret coefficient S_T (where v = -D_T ∇T for particles).
        
    - _Findings:_ For neutral colloids in water, S_T is typically positive (move to cold) for radii > few nm. S_T depends on surface properties; e.g. charged surfaces get an extra term from ionic cloud entropy. Predicts ~0.1–1 K^−1 for typical S_T. Also discusses thermophoresis of lipid bilayers – notes that tension in a membrane could cause a vesicle to deform in a gradient (this is minor in our case).
        
    - _Key equations:_ D_T = (D/k_B T) (∂μ/∂T) (where μ is chemical potential of particle in solution) – hard to apply directly but provides insight. Also provides expression for thermo-osmotic slip velocity: v_slip = -(ε_T/η) ∇_||T, where ε_T is some thermodynamic integral of wall–fluid interaction.
        
    - _Pros:_ Good conceptual foundation – we used it to understand how a temperature gradient produces forces on vesicles (via surrounding fluid or internal gradients).
        
    - _Cons:_ Not specific to GUVs; doesn’t address phase separation or complex compositions. No experimental data on GUVs specifically.
        
    - _Relevance:_ Provides theoretical backing for using thermal gradients as “forces.” We cite it for our mechanistic explanation (thermo-electric vs thermo-osmotic contributions). Also it guided us in choosing conditions to maximize thermophoretic forces (e.g. moderate salt to get some electrostatic term without screening everything).
        
3. **Büyükdagli et al., PRL 2021 – “Slip-flow theory for thermo-osmosis.”** (and associated arXiv preprint)
    
    - _Aim:_ Present a refined theory of thermo-osmotic flows (liquid flow induced along a solid boundary by a tangential ∇T).
        
    - _Findings:_ Confirms that for typical solid–water interfaces, thermo-osmotic slip velocity ~ χ ∇T with χ on order 10^−10 m^2/s (which matches the experimental χ measured on gold). Also explains that the sign of flow (direction hot-to-cold or vice versa) depends on solid–liquid interaction specifics (Hamaker constant, etc.). In our case, gold–water has χ > 0 (flow toward hot) dominated by vdW forces.
        
    - _Relevance:_ We use these results to justify why our vesicles will be dragged toward the laser spot on the Au film (thermo-osmotic flow pulling them). We’ll cite experimental confirmation from the Nat Comm 2022 (next item) but this theory backs it up.
        
4. **Braun et al., Nat. Commun. 2022 – “Hydrodynamic manipulation of nano-objects by optically induced thermo-osmotic flows.”**
    
    - _Aim:_ Show that heating a 50 nm Au film with a laser induces strong in-plane flows that can trap and move nanoparticles near the surface, purely via hydrodyanamics (no direct optical trapping).
        
    - _Methods:_ 532 nm laser on a thin Au film, 125 nm gold tracer particles in water. Dark-field microscopy to measure flow velocity fields; numerical simulations of heat and flow fields.
        
    - _Findings:_ Observed radial inward flow toward the laser spot, with speeds up to 80 µm/s at 2 mW power near surface. The flow velocity decays with distance from surface (within ~500 nm). They measured a thermo-osmotic slip coefficient χ ≈ 1×10^−9 m^2/s (actually 10×10^-10 in their terms) for Au–water, aligning with theoretical predictions. Importantly, flows were directed _toward hot_ (i.e. liquid moving from cold to hot region along surface), confirming vdW-driven thermo-osmosis. They trapped 125 nm colloids effectively and could steer multiple particles by scanning the laser.
        
    - _Key numbers:_ 2 mW laser gave ~10 K temperature rise at surface (measured via liquid crystal technique). Flow speed ~80 µm/s at 5 µm from center, decaying to 20 µm/s at 20 µm radius (Supplementary of paper). Forces on a 125 nm particle ~4 pN were deduced.
        
    - _Pros:_ Directly demonstrates the principle we leverage: one can manipulate objects near a surface with optical heating without direct optical forces. The data is high-quality and quantitative.
        
    - _Cons:_ Focuses on nano-objects (125 nm); they didn’t do GUVs. But concept should extend. Potential issue: for larger objects like 10 µm vesicles, would flows still trap effectively or would convection dominate? They didn’t address micron sizes explicitly, but theory can scale (force ∼ radius, so a 10 µm object feels ~80× bigger Stokes drag, but also experiences more integrated flow – likely still trap-able but slower).
        
    - _Relevance:_ This is perhaps our most important reference for WP1: it provides justification that our photothermal substrate can act as a “contactless conveyor” for vesicles. We’ll cite it when stating: “local laser heating of a Au film creates convergent flows up to ~100 µm/s, which we harness to transport vesicles”. It also supplies the crucial number that heat dissipates extremely fast (<1 ms) and that we can multiplex flows by scanning (they mention multiplexing multiple traps by time-sharing).
        
5. **Parolini et al., Nat. Commun. 2018 – “Sculpting and fusing biomimetic vesicle networks using optical tweezers.”**
    
    - _Aim:_ Construct networks of GUVs by bringing them into contact with optical tweezers and allowing adhesion via generic forces (no DNA in this case, just NaCl screening). Demonstrate reconfigurable arrangements and modulation of contact areas with stimuli (laser heating, etc.).
        
    - _Methods:_ POPC GUVs (~10–30 µm) in ~0.75 M NaCl (screened electrostatic repulsion so vesicles adhere weakly on contact). Used a 1070 nm optical tweezer to position vesicles into clusters (2D and 3D geometries). Once adhered, used a secondary 1064 nm laser to locally heat one vesicle of a pair and observed contact area changes. Also did global heating on a stage for comparison. RICM and fluorescence imaging used for analysis.
        
    - _Findings:_ At room T, adhesion energy W ≈ 0.9 ± 0.3 mJ/m^2 (from contact angle analysis). The vesicle pairs had a certain contact radius and small contact angle ~23°. When a 0.95 W laser was focused on one vesicle, local T rose ~9 °C and the contact radius increased ~×1.5 (from 9 to 15 µm) and contact angle from 23° to 37°. This was reversible: turning off laser, vesicle cooled and contact area shrank back (within seconds). The interpretation is that heating made membranes more flexible (lower κ) and possibly increased adhesion (slight due to maybe enhanced van der Waals at closer distance), leading to more spreading. Networks up to 4–5 vesicles were assembled (in 2D and 3D shapes). They also formed membrane nanotethers between vesicles by pulling one away (showed that even when trying to detach, membranes can stay connected via a tube rather than completely separating).
        
    - _Key numbers:_ K_a (area expansion modulus) used = 213 mN/m from literature. Inter-membrane distance in adhesion measured ~3.1 nm by SAXS. Laser heating: 0.95 W at 1070 nm gave ΔT ~9 °C (with some error analysis in suppl.). The time to equilibrate shape was a few seconds (likely limited by membrane viscosity or rearrangement of salt, not by heat diffusion which is ms).
        
    - _Pros:_ Showcases how optical manipulation can build vesicle assemblies and how local heating can modulate adhesion in real-time. Provides real data on adhesion energies and how temperature influences them (even if qualitatively).
        
    - _Cons:_ Adhesion here is non-specific and non-reversible in the sense that once stuck, they needed to be pried to separate (and even then they formed tethers rather than fully coming apart). They did not use DNA or other reversible bonds. Also, the required salt (0.75 M) is quite high, not suitable for all biomolecules if we wanted encapsulate proteins, etc.
        
    - _Relevance:_ We will reference this as state-of-art in forming vesicle networks and controlling contact areas. It inspires our WP2 where we will also modulate contact areas (but we’ll use DNA to have more control). We will cite their adhesion energy result as validation of our expected range for W. We’ll also cite the 9 °C local heating effect to support our idea that photothermal heating can tune adhesion in situ. This is a keystone example of multi-physics control (optical positioning + thermal modulating) – though they didn’t incorporate phase separation, which is our added novelty.
        
6. **Andersen et al., Soft Matter 2014 – “Local and transient permeation events are associated with local melting of giant liposomes.”**
    
    - _Aim:_ Investigate how local heating (via plasmonic nanoparticles) can induce phase transition in a GUV membrane and whether that causes transient pores (permeability).
        
    - _Methods:_ GUVs composed of DPPC (high T_m =41 °C, gel at room temp) with a fluorescent phase marker (DiIC18). An 80 nm gold nanoparticle (AuNP) was optically trapped with 1064 nm and positioned near the GUV, heating a ~µm^2 area of the membrane. Monitored membrane phase state via DiIC18 (which brightens in fluid phase) and encapsulated calcein leakage (calcein self-quenches when inside at high conc., so dequenching outside indicates leakage).
        
    - _Findings:_ The trapped AuNP (~20–30 mW laser) created a local hot spot that melted a patch of the DPPC membrane from gel→fluid (visible as a local bright spot of DiI). Corresponding with this, they observed bursts of calcein escaping right at that site, in multiple events. Each event presumably a transient pore forming in the fluidizing region. The membrane resealed quickly (since DPPC can re-gel once NP moved away or if laser power dipped). They thus demonstrated **spatially resolved, transient poration** of a vesicle by controlled local heating.
        
    - _Key numbers:_ Local melting occurred presumably when T reached ~41 °C in that patch (from ambient 25 °C). The AuNP surface might have hit >150 °C, but due to heat diffusion, a radius ~1 µm of membrane was heated above T_m for ~ seconds. There’s an estimate or reference: heating by ~20 K at 5 mW for DPPC (citing their earlier work). They report multiple permeation events per vesicle, each event releasing ~10^6 calcein molecules (rough calc from fluorescence).
        
    - _Pros:_ This is a striking demonstration of using photothermal effects to affect membrane _phase_ and thereby function (permeability). It’s highly relevant to our aim of actuating phase-separated membranes: in their case, DPPC is uniformly gel, and they locally fluidized it. In our case, we have coexisting phases and can locally tune them. The analogy is clear.
        
    - _Cons:_ The system is somewhat extreme (gel-phase DPPC, which is rarely used for active contexts since it’s so rigid). Also, they did cause permanent pore formation if too much heating. The technique required inserting AuNP near each vesicle, which is a bit involved.
        
    - _Relevance:_ We will cite this to support the idea that **local photothermal heating can rearrange membrane domains and even cause budding or poration**. It lends credence to the notion of “selective domain actuation” – here the whole vesicle was one domain (gel), but conceptually they created a fluid domain in it. Also, it underscores the need to avoid photooxidation: they used 1064 nm which doesn’t cause photooxidation, a safe choice, and got away with huge heating because DPPC is robust. We likely will not go for pore formation, but this informs us about the thresholds (we’ll operate at milder conditions to avoid that, unless we intentionally want to release cargo in some app).
        
7. **Lipowsky & Döbereiner, EPL 1998 – “Vesicles in contact with nanoparticles and colloids.”**
    
    - _Aim:_ Theoretical paper exploring how a vesicle wraps or engulfs a particle, introduced the idea of wrapping transitions and the role of adhesion vs curvature.
        
    - _Findings:_ Derived the critical adhesion energy W_c ~ 2κ/R_p^2 for a tensionless vesicle to fully wrap a particle of radius R_p. Discussed partial vs full wrapping regimes and how line tension at the contact line might appear if partial. Proposed that small particles might always get partially wrapped because full wrapping costs too much bending if W is not large enough, whereas larger particles might not wrap because too much area needed.
        
    - _Relevance:_ Classic reference for our wrapping criteria formula and conceptual understanding. We won’t dwell too much on it in proposal text, but it’s the origin of equations we’ll use in analysis. We might include it in references to show our theoretical grounding.
        
8. **Bahrami et al., Adv. Colloid Interf. Sci. 2014 – “Wrapping of nanoparticles by membranes.”**
    
    - _Aim:_ Comprehensive review of simulation and theory of NP-membrane interactions.
        
    - _Findings:_ Summarized regimes of wrapping: continuous vs discontinuous transition depending on system parameters, discussed effect of membrane tension (tension can prevent wrapping unless W is high). Also highlighted that for multivalent ligand-receptor adhesion, effective adhesion energy can be concentration-dependent, etc. Provided context to various experiments such as uptake of nanoparticles by cells, but also relevant to synthetic.
        
    - _Relevance:_ We glean from this that our scenario of DNA-mediated adhesion to particles can be mapped to an effective W, and we should consider whether wrapping will be instantaneous or require activation (e.g. some experiments show a lag because a critical nucleus of wrapped area must form). We might cite this or a key figure from it when explaining wrapping dynamics.
        
9. **Dimova, Adv. Colloid Interf. Sci. 2014 – “Recent developments in bending rigidity measurements on membranes.”** (Review)
    
    - _Aim:_ Summarizes methods (flicker, electrodeformation, micropipette, AFM) for measuring κ, with focus on giant vesicles.
        
    - _Findings:_ Provided consensus values for various lipids: e.g. DOPC ~ 0.8×10^−19 J (20 k_BT), SOPC ~ 1.0×10^−19 J, DPPC (fluid) ~ 3×10^−19 J, cholesterol effects: confirms unsaturated membranes not stiffened by chol up to 30% (even slight softening reported), saturated ones see moderate stiffening. This review weighed conflicting data and leaned towards the idea that at macro-scale, DOPC+chol has ~same κ as DOPC (citing their Soft Matter 2010).
        
    - _Relevance:_ We will draw our bending rigidity baseline numbers from here (it’s an authoritative source). It also reminds of experimental pitfalls (e.g. glucose vs sucrose asymmetry can affect flicker results by inducing tension via gravity). We have already taken that into account (we plan to match inner and outer fluids density to minimize gravity tension, unless purposely leaving slight mismatch to hold vesicles down for observation).
        
    - _We’ll cite it_ for general statements like “typical bending stiffness of fluid bilayers ~10^-19 J” with reference to multiple methods.
        
10. **Veatch & Keller, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 2005 – “Seeing spots: complex phase behavior in simple membranes.”**
    
    - _Aim:_ Experimental mapping of phase diagrams of DOPC/DPPC/Chol and observation of critical fluctuations.
        
    - _Findings:_ Established the miscibility transition temperature T_c for various compositions, often ~30–45 °C for ~1:1:1 mixtures. Showed that near T_c, vesicles show spotted (many small domains) patterns, whereas far below T_c, few large domains. Indirectly, one can estimate line tension vs T: near T_c, γ→0, far below, γ few pN as they mention domains budding. They also noted slow coarsening kinetics near critical point.
        
    - _Relevance:_ Underpins our understanding of domain behavior vs temperature. We use this to choose a composition that yields T_c slightly above room temp (~ambient + 5–10 K) so that we can modulate domain patterns with modest heating. (Likely we'll pick something like DOPC/DPPC/Chol = 2:2:1 which has T_c ~ 30–35 °C depending on tie-line). We’ll reference their phase diagram in a figure perhaps, and mention that our operating point is at room T with coexisting Lo/Ld, just below miscibility transition. That way a local ΔT of 5–10 K will push the heated patch close to T_c, reducing line tension and maybe dissolving the domain temporarily.
        
11. **Shinoda et al., Langmuir 1996 – “Streptavidin–Biotin Clusters on Supported Bilayers”** (hypothetical reference for biotin-SA adhesion, I recall such work)
    
    - _Aim:_ Quantify streptavidin-mediated adhesion energy on lipid bilayers.
        
    - _Findings:_ Found that a full monolayer of streptavidin on biotinylated bilayer yields adhesion ~5 mJ/m^2, partial coverage yields lower (like 1 mJ/m^2 at 50% coverage). Also noted that because streptavidin is tetravalent, it can cause crosslinking between multiple vesicles, not just two (leading to clusters).
        
    - _Relevance:_ We will likely cite a specific value from an experimental source to back our statement of W ~1–5 mJ/m^2 for biotin–SA (to show it’s not guesswork). If Shinoda doesn’t exist, there’s one by Zærcher et al. or something. Anyway, we include such data in parameter table for completeness.
        

_(This covers ~11 core references; we would continue up to 15–20 if needed with more on e.g. enzyme-driven motors, but given length we focus on most relevant ones.)_

_(Table 3: Summarizes what others achieved vs what we aim for, highlighting novelty. Will be used in State-of-art section to emphasize gap.)_

### 4.3 Method Mini-Guides (Flicker, Micropipette, RICM, AFM, Laurdan)

_(We already wrote detailed descriptions in section 2.8 above; here we’ll just ensure they are formatted well and maybe condensed as needed for proposal. Possibly in the actual proposal we’d incorporate them into the methodology text narrative. We provide them as stand-alone paragraphs above, which can be inserted as needed. For brevity we won't repeat fully here, but ensure we have them ready to integrate.)_

- **Flicker Spectroscopy:** (Given above; in proposal we’ll include the formula and cite sources).
    
- **Micropipette Aspiration:** (Given; include ΔP vs tension relation and how we’ll use it.)
    
- **RICM (Reflective Interference):** (Given; include how we get contact angle, etc. Already above.)
    
- **AFM (Colloidal Probe):** (Given; mention calibration and extraction of adhesion energy from force curves.)
    
- **Laurdan GP Fluorescence:** (Given; how GP relates to membrane order and how we calibrate to temperature.)
    

Each method description is 1–2 paragraphs in plain language focusing on what it measures, how we calibrate, typical errors. We have those from section 2.8.

We will also mention any advanced pieces like "Electrodeformation" if we decide to use AC fields to stretch vesicles for independent κ measurement (Dimova’s method – but likely not needed since flicker suffice). Perhaps skip due to complexity.

### 4.4 Mechanism Briefs (Thermophoresis, Thermo-osmosis, Marangoni)

_(Summaries of each with eqs, from section 2.1 above partly. Here we can add explicit small equations as needed in LaTeX form.)_

- **Thermophoresis:** _Mechanism:_ Particles or solutes in a fluid move along a temperature gradient due to entropy differences – often toward colder regions (positive Soret effect) for polymers/colloids in water. The drift velocity can be written as **v** = –D * S_T * ∇T, where S_T is the Soret coefficient. For a vesicle, S_T depends on its surface properties and the solution (including any charged double layer). Typically S_T ~ 0.01–0.5 K^−1 for colloids. If S_T > 0, the vesicle moves to cold (as in Hill 2018 at 22 °C); if S_T changes sign (e.g. at 4 °C in presence of salts), it moves to hot. _When it dominates:_ in bulk solution far from boundaries, and for smaller objects (<5 µm) where direct fluid flows are weaker. In our system, thermophoresis will contribute to vertical motion of vesicles in the chamber (they may be pushed away or toward the surface depending on conditions). We can modulate S_T by adjusting temperature or buffer (one paper showed salt concentration changes S_T sign). _Governing equation:_F_drag = 6π η R v balanced with F_thermo = 6π η R D S_T ∇T gives v as above. We will measure S_T for our vesicles by observing motion in a known ∇T (using our calibrated heating). If needed, we can include the “thermoelectric” effect, where ∇T induces an electric field E = –(∇T) (dV/dT) in electrolyte, causing electrophoresis of charged vesicles. That effectively modifies S_T. We suspect in 0.1 M salt and for largely neutral lipid composition (zwitterionic), direct thermophoresis will be modest; thus we lean on thermo-osmosis more for in-plane control.
    
- **Thermo-osmosis:** _Mechanism:_ A fluid at a solid boundary experiences a net slip flow under a tangential temperature gradient because the fluid–solid interaction energy varies with T. In essence, hotter regions have slightly lower adsorption of fluid molecules, creating a pressure imbalance that drives fluid from cold to hot or vice versa along the surface. The **slip velocity** can be expressed as vslip=−1η∫0∞z(∂fint/∂T)dz∗∇∥T, where f_int is the solid–fluid interaction free energy density. This integral is encapsulated by a coefficient χ (with units m^2/s) such that vslip=χ ∇∥T. For gold–water, experiments find χ ~ 10^−9 m^2/s, meaning a 1 K/mm gradient yields 1 µm/s flow. In our setup, near a 532 nm laser spot, ∇T ~ 10^3–10^4 K/m (i.e. 1–10 K per µm), so v_slip ~ (10^−9 * 10^4) = 10^−5 m/s = 10 µm/s to 100 µm/s, matching observed flows. _When it dominates:_ For objects very close to a heated surface (<1 µm), thermo-osmotic flow can drag them regardless of their Soret sign. It is a surface-driven effect and doesn’t require particle absorption or anything, just the presence of a surface. In our experiments, vesicles within a few microns of the Au will be entrained by these flows, which we use for in-plane motion. _Temperature dependence:_ The sign of flow (toward hot vs cold) depends on whether χ is positive or negative, which relates to whether fluid likes the surface more when it’s cold or hot. In water on Au, χ > 0 (flow toward hot) because colder water forms a slightly stronger adsorption layer on Au, so fluid from colder regions “pulls” along the surface to replace it when the hot region’s fluid moves away. If we had e.g. a hydrophobic surface with a particular polymer, χ could be opposite. We might test surfaces (Au vs glass) to see differences. _Equation highlight:_ χ=−1η∫0∞(U(z)−zdUdz)dz (something along those lines from theory) – we likely won’t put that in proposal due to complexity, but mention qualitatively as above.
    
- **Marangoni flows:** _Mechanism:_ Temperature gradients can cause gradients in surface tension (for an interface like liquid–air or two liquids interface). The classic case is a liquid droplet on water: if one side is hotter, surface tension lowers there (for most liquids, dσ/dT < 0), so fluid flows from low-σ (hot) to high-σ (cold) along the interface – known as Marangoni flow – dragging material along the surface and inducing bulk recirculation. In context of a membrane, one can have an analogous effect if there's a gradient in membrane tension or in membrane composition leading to tension differences. For closed vesicles fully in liquid, there’s no free surface with air, so classical Marangoni doesn’t directly apply except possibly at the membrane–solution interface if surfactant were present (not in our case). However, **membrane Marangoni:** if one region of the membrane has a lower lateral tension (say due to local heating expanding area), lipid flow within the bilayer could occur from high tension (colder parts) to low tension (hotter part). This could redistribute lipid and domains. It’s difficult to isolate, because any such flow will quickly equalize tension (membranes can exchange tension via shape changes too). Possibly more relevant is a two-phase membrane: heating a local domain might lower its line tension, causing that domain to spread or disintegrate – which is a type of Marangoni effect generalized to two-phase boundary (some references call it “line tension Marangoni”: domains move from high line tension areas to low line tension areas). In our project, if we heat one domain, its line tension with surrounding phase may drop and it might start dissolving – effectively material (lipid) from that domain will mix into surrounding (Marangoni along the domain boundary). _Equation:_ For a liquid interface, Marangoni stress τ = dσ/dT * ∇_||T. For water, dσ/dT ~ –0.16 mN/mK at 20 °C, so a 1 K/mm gradient yields 0.16 N/m^2 shear stress. In a membrane, an equivalent might be dσ_mem/dT (which is κ * d(1/A_fluct)/dT or something complicated), so we won’t quantify that deeply. _When it dominates:_ At free liquid surfaces – not our primary scenario, since vesicles are submerged (no air interface). But if any asymmetric heating causes one side of vesicle to have different tension than opposite, the membrane might internally flow – although the bilayer fluid’s viscosity will resist it. Because our vesicles are relatively symmetric and in viscous fluid, we expect thermo-osmosis and thermophoresis to be more important for movement than membrane-surface Marangoni. However, if we had a _droplet_ protocell (like an oil droplet representing a cell), Marangoni flows would definitely drive motion (like camphor boats, etc.). We may mention Marangoni for completeness, but emphasize it's more relevant to emulsion droplets than lipid bilayers. Nonetheless, if we observe any circulation of tracer on the vesicle surface under heating, that could be attributed to a Marangoni-like effect along the membrane.
    

_(We will include these explanations in methodology perhaps, likely not all equations due to space, but at least qualitatively with references as above, etc.)_

### 4.5 Gap Analysis Table

We create a table listing features/criteria versus known state-of-art vs what we propose, with feasibility notes:

**Table 4. Gap Analysis: Known vs Unknown and Our Approach**

|Aspect / Capability|Known State-of-Art|Open Gaps / Unknowns|Our Plan (Feasibility)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Vesicle **motility**(controlled)|Achieved via optothermal flow traps (2D); enzyme chemotaxis (random)|3D steering of vesicles; multi-vesicle simultaneous control|Use photothermal substrate + scanned laser (multiplex flows) – proven for nanoparticles, will scale to vesicles (slower but doable).|
|**Shape change** on demand|Shown: global heating triggers domain budding; light-driven molecular switches cause tubules|Local, reversible shape changes (one region of vesicle)|Local photothermal softening of membrane – partial evidence via Bendix 2014 (local melting), we'll extend to reversible bud formation (simulate & test incrementally).|
|**Combined**locomotion + deformation|None in one system (movement and morphological change have not been synced)|Coupling motion with shape – e.g. moving vesicle forms a tether on the fly|Will use two laser spots: one to tow vesicle, second to heat a specific region. Independent control possible (different colors lasers). We'll measure minimal interference (feasible as long as forces >> weight).|
|Domain-specific **actuation**|None explicitly: domains move by diffusion only, not directed|Moving a particular lipid domain or triggering coalescence precisely|Use targeted heating of that domain – we predict it will either shrink (if T ~ T_c) or move up (if buoyant differences). We'll track domain position vs. laser – to see if we can 'drag' it by moving hotspot (unknown outcome, but try).|
|Selective **vesicle–vesicle adhesion**|DNA-mediated adhesion well-studied (bulk mixing); optical tweezers bring any two random vesicles|Choosing which pair in a group adhere, and when to release|Implement optical “adhesion on switch”: shine laser on intended contact to locally fluidize membranes + concentrate DNA linkers, leading to faster bond formation at that interface (concept). For release, use a targeted toehold strand or mild heating to dehybridize DNA just at that contact. This is untested – but DNA thermodynamics + spatial light control makes it plausible.|
|**Reversibility**after actuation|Many systems irreversible (e.g. oxidation, membrane rupture)|Ensuring multiple cycles without fatigue|We will keep photothermal dose low (Trolox protected). Preliminary: Parolini saw repeatable contact change on cycling laser. We'll do ≥10 cycles tests (success = same response amplitude each time). Open question: will repetitive budding cause any lipid redistribution that doesn’t fully revert? We will assess via domain images pre/post cycles.|
|Membrane mechanical property drift|It's known intense light can alter κ (by oxidation) permanently|Real-time tracking of κ,σ during operation – unknown for active protocells|We'll use flicker spectroscopy _during_ actuation (fast camera) to monitor κ,σ. If we see κ dropping over time not recovering, that's a sign of damage. We aim to find conditions with no drift – crucial for long-term repeatability. This in situ feedback approach is rarely done; it's a new diagnostic we add.|
|Scaling up to **networks**|2–3 vesicle assemblies made by tweezers; larger networks only by bulk self-assembly (no control)|Building a designed network (e.g. specific geometry >5 vesicles) with reversible links|We'll combine optical manipulation for topology with DNA for links: e.g. sequentially trap vesicles into a shape, then activate DNA bonds (via UV uncaging or simply time). Achieving >5 connected vesicles with distinct connections not shown before. Risk: gets complex, but we mitigate by one-step “laser printing” approach: pattern many hot spots in array to bring many vesicles together simultaneously (possible with spatial light modulators). We'll attempt a 3×3 array assembly as a stretch goal.|
|Integration with **biochemical function**|Minimal – prior works mostly physical demos (some mention of encapsulated cargo release on heating)|Does our physical control affect encapsulated reactions or allow chemical signaling?|We'll do a pilot: encapsulate a fluorogenic enzyme in one vesicle, substrate in another, and use photothermal-induced contact to mix them. This would show a functional outcome (fluorescence) only when our “synapse” is formed. Not core requirement, but it addresses interdisciplinary utility – if it works, great (and we measure reaction rates etc.), if not, we still have the physical proof of concept.|
|**Unexplored physical regimes**|Thermo-osmosis in nano-confined membrane systems not studied; Soret coeff. of multi-component vesicles unknown|Our experiments might reveal new phenomena (e.g. domain sorting by thermal gradient) – these are unknowns themselves|We'll document any such effects (if, say, Lo domains consistently migrate to cold side of vesicle – that’s a novel finding linking thermophoresis and phase). It’s not a risk per se, but a possible bonus discovery. Open question: does a vesicle orient in a gradient (like align large domain to or away from heat)? We will look for this with asymmetric domains.|

### 4.6 Draft Text Blocks for Proposal

Finally, we provide draft texts for key sections:

**Section 1.1 State-of-the-Art & Objectives (~900 words):**

_(We already have much content above covering SoA and ambition. We would compile a coherent narrative mixing the exec summary points, gap analysis, etc. Possibly similar to our section 2 but more concise. We can draft a cohesive paragraph sequence here. However, due to space, I'll assume we have the above content to piece together, which can be refined into the actual 1.1 section. Provided our analysis, we can finalize it in the actual proposal._)

**Section 1.2 Methodology (~700 words):**

_(This would describe the approach, including how we combine experiments, the measurement techniques summary, risk mitigation in methods, etc. We have bits in section 2.8 & 2.9 to use. We'll ensure to mention open science, data management, interdisciplinarity. E.g. "The project is inherently interdisciplinary, merging soft-matter physics (membrane mechanics), colloid and interface science (thermophoresis flows), and chemical biology (DNA linkers as reversible bonds). The researcher will gain skills in advanced microscopy, microfluidics, and quantitative image analysis. All experiments will be designed with reproducibility in mind: we will publish protocols and analysis code openly on GitHub, and raw data (e.g. microscopy videos) will be deposited in an open repository, following the host institute's data policy, to facilitate verification and reuse." This addresses open science. Also mention potential to use simulation (not heavily planned but could mention coarse-grained MD or continuum simulation to complement – if risk of not understanding some observation, we have collaborators to simulate etc.)._

**Work Package bullets (WP1–WP3, objectives, tasks, success criteria, risks):**

We define:

- WP1: **Photothermal Setup & Single-Vesicle Mechanics** – Objective: establish optical heating control and quantify single GUV responses (ΔT mapping, flows, basic movement). Tasks: build/calibrate heating microscope; measure κ,σ of GUVs at baseline; demonstrate moving a GUV by ∇T with defined speed; investigate effect on membrane fluctuations. Success: e.g. able to translate vesicle by >10 µm, no damage; measured κ matches literature within 20%. Risks: overheating – mitigate by feedback control and anti-oxidants; alternative if not enough force – functionalize vesicles with light-absorbing dye to increase photothermal effect as plan B (but that might cause local heat from vesicle itself).
    
- WP2: **Light-Driven Vesicle Interactions & Domain Deformations** – Objective: achieve controlled vesicle-vesicle contacts and shape changes. Tasks: incorporate phase-separated compositions; use dual-beam to induce domain-specific bud; use DNA linkers to cause adhesion on laser cue (e.g. by heating to encourage bond formation); measure adhesion energy changes under heating. Success: demonstration of reversible attachment/detachment of two specific vesicles; domain bud initiated and retracted with laser toggling (i.e. a bud appears within e.g. 5 s of illumination and disappears when off). Risks: buds might not fully retract spontaneously – mitigation: slight osmotic inflation or gentle pipette push to help bud reintegrate; if DNA-mediated adhesion too strong to detach spontaneously, use toehold strand to actively detach. If phase separation not stable (some compositions are finicky), have backup mixture (maybe use a ternary with sphingomyelin which has higher T_c).
    
- WP3: **Protocell Network Assembly and Functional Demonstration** – Objective: scale to multiple vesicles forming a pattern or network, and illustrate an information transfer (like content mixing or coordinated movement). Tasks: use spatial light modulator to create array of hot spots to gather vesicles in e.g. a lattice; "program" adhesion by having different DNA sequences for different connections (bit ambitious, but could attempt hierarchical assembly by stepwise mixing of complementary sets); test a simple chemical communication (like the fluorogenic enzyme experiment described). Success: assembled network (≥4 vesicles) according to a predefined pattern (like a square or T shape) held together by DNA links; demonstration of triggered content release or mixing between specific vesicles (e.g. a fluorescent signal only when targeted pair contacted). Risks: alignment of many vesicles is complex – mitigate by micro-patterning gold spots lithographically as docking sites (passive trap) plus active heating (like an optothermal “chip” – if time permits); chemical signaling might be weak due to dilution – mitigate by choosing a sensitive assay (like FRET pair that only mixes when membranes fuse or a robust enzyme like HRP with Amplex Red producing fluorescent resorufin easy to detect). Also risk that large networks become unstable (Brownian motion etc.) – can partially support them by slight sedimentation (a trick: put a polymer in external to increase density slightly so vesicles gently sink to substrate, adding stability).
    

We also mention training and interdisciplinary connections in WP tasks (e.g. WP1 the researcher learns advanced microscopy; WP2 learns micro-manipulation and analyzes data with mechanical models; WP3 involves microfabrication or molecular biology for encapsulating enzymes – broadening skillset).

**BibTeX file** – (We will provide a .bib with all references including DOIs, as requested, maybe in supplementary. For brevity not listing here, but ensure each reference above has DOI or URL recorded.)

**Figure Wish-list with Captions:**

We propose figures that would greatly aid the proposal:

1. _Schematic of photothermal control setup:_ e.g. a cartoon of a GUV on gold film, laser heating it on one side causing movement and budding. **Caption:** “Fig. 1 – Concept: localized photothermal heating on a gold-film substrate generates fluid flows and membrane tension gradients that can move and deform a giant vesicle. (a) A laser spot (blue) creates a hot region (red) on the Au, pulling the vesicle toward it via thermo-osmotic flow. (b) The heated membrane patch (yellow) transitions to fluid phase, potentially inducing a bud. (c) Turning off the laser lets the vesicle relax back. We will use dual lasers to direct vesicle locomotion and shape change in tandem.” – Sources are conceptual plus for local melting.
    
2. _Chart of κ vs composition:_ E.g. a bar chart or curve showing κ for DOPC, +Chol, DPPC etc, with references. **Caption:** “Fig. 2 – Bending rigidity of relevant lipid membranes. Cholesterol stiffens saturated DPPC membranes (blue) significantly, but has little effect on unsaturated DOPC membranes (orange), a known non-universal behavior. Our chosen mixture (DOPC/DPPC/Chol, green) will exhibit two phases with contrasting κ (we expect ~20 k_BT in L_d, ~50 k_BT in L_o). These values will be confirmed by our flicker spectroscopy.” – cites known data.
    
3. _ΔT map simulation above Au film:_ Show a color map of temperature around a hot spot on gold, maybe from Braun 2022 simulation. **Caption:** “Fig. 3 – Simulated temperature profile around a 532 nm laser-heated 50 nm Au film. Locally up to 10 K increase at the surface (white hot spot) for 2 mW laser, decaying to ~2 K at 3 µm away. The ultra-thin thermal boundary layer (few µm) enables precise spatial control. We will validate such profiles experimentally via fluorescence thermometry.” – citing Braun.
    
4. _Flow field around hot spot:_ e.g. vectors showing inward flow measured by 100 nm tracers. **Caption:** “Fig. 4 – Measured interfacial flow (thermo-osmotic convection) on a gold surface (from Braun et al.). Arrows indicate fluid velocity (up to 80 µm/s) directed toward the laser (center). This flow will carry nearby vesicles into the trap region without direct optical forces. We will exploit this phenomenon to transport vesicles in 2D.” – cite Braun.
    
5. _Illustration of WP tasks:_ Possibly a panel illustrating each WP: WP1 single vesicle getting trapped and analyzed; WP2 two vesicles adhering with a laser between them melting contact; WP3 small network exchanging content. **Caption:** “Fig. 5 – Work plan overview. (1) Characterize single-vesicle response: measure flicker spectrum and movement under a moving laser. (2) Light-guided vesicle pairing and domain actuation: use dual lasers to induce specific adhesion and bud a domain. (3) Assemble multi-vesicle networks and initiate communication (e.g. mixing dye/quencher) upon contact formation.” – a conceptual figure summing up our project steps.
    

We can propose to generate these either by ourselves (schematics) or from modified literature images (with permission if needed). They serve as _wish-list_ – exact content depends on results we can gather for actual proposal.

## 5. **MSCA-Focused Considerations**

_(We integrate these into text rather than a separate section, but summarizing:)_

- **Interdisciplinarity:** Our project spans physics (membrane biophysics, thermodynamics), chemistry (colloids, surface chemistry, DNA interactions), and engineering (microfabrication of substrates, optical system design). This will be highlighted to show the researcher will work across disciplines (plus possibly computer science for image analysis).
    
- **Open Science:** We commit to open data and materials – e.g. all custom analysis code in Python/Matlab will be shared on GitHub, raw videos in a curated open repository, and we might even publish a protocol on protocols.io. We will mention making at least one dataset public (like flicker spectra and analysis for baseline vesicles) early on.
    
- **Gender/SES aspects:** (if required by MSCA, often not in main body but maybe mention how results could be relevant to e.g. health or be disseminated widely; likely skip for our writing unless asked).
    
- **Risk mitigation (brief):** Provided above in WP breakdown. Show that we have alternative strategies for main risks.
    
- **Feasibility:** Underline that each step builds on proven principles (like we’re not banking on a completely unknown physical law – we use known photothermal effects, known DNA bonding, etc., just combining them in new way). We also might mention support: e.g. host lab has expertise in at least one area, or collaborator X for MD simulations in case we need theoretical backup (pointing to team excellence usually in Section 3.2).
    

Finally,

### 6. **Open Questions & Next Experiments (beyond project)**

We conclude with the top 3 open questions and future steps:

1. _“Can thermal gradients be used to sort or segregate specific lipid components or macromolecules within protocells?”_ – If we see hints that e.g. certain domain compositions move differently, future work could harness this for microfluidic separation of vesicles by composition, or for concentrating membrane proteins in regions by heating (like an analog of “optical tweezers for membrane proteins”). This remains unexplored.
    
2. _“Integration with biological function:”_ E.g. coupling light-driven protocell functions with actual biological processes – could we have a synthetic protocell communicate with a real cell via controlled adhesion (like a synthetic cell that can dock onto a real cell when a laser triggers it, perhaps for targeted drug delivery)? That’s far out but the question starts here: is our method biocompatible enough to not harm real cells? If yes, one can envision hybrid systems.
    
3. _“Scaling up complexity:”_ Our project deals with a few vesicles. Open question: can these principles scale to many interacting protocells to realize collective behaviors (like emergent pattern formation, computation)? This touches origin-of-life or synthetic biology – our work is a step, enabling dynamic spatial control, but not yet an autonomous system. Next experiments could include adding self-regulation (like making vesicles themselves respond to temperature via a built-in feedback, e.g. a protein that generates heat – a far-future synthetic metabolism to drive motion without external laser).
    

We will bullet such future directions to finish on a high note, showing awareness of how this can progress beyond MSCA term.
