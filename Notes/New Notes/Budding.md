Process in which a structure grows or forms as an outward protrusion from an existing entity. In the context of lipid membranes, cell biology, or biophysics, budding specifically describes the formation of a small, vesicle-like structure or domain that separates from a larger membrane.

> The most prominent example of a shape transformation is the budding transition shown in figure 1, where the shape change of an initially spherical vesicle is recorded with video microscopy. As the temperature increases, the sphere becomes a prolate ellipsoid. While this transformation may seem inevitable given that the thermal expansion of the area is much larger than that of the enclosed volume, the surprise is the occurrence of a pear shape with broken up/down symmetry as the temperature is increased further. At even higher temperature, the neck closes, resulting in two spherical compartments that are sitting on top of each other but still connected by a narrow constriction. In all but the first and last shape, the video exhibits pronounced fluctuations which the still pictures, of course, cannot convey.
