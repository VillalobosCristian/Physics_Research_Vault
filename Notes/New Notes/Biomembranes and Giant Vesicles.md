![[Bilayer.excalidraw|600]]
The lipid bilayer is the simplest [[Biomimetic]] biomembrane, which can be composed of a single type of lipid. 
[[Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs)|GUVs]] can be visualized in their fluid state by microscopy.

When the bilayer form a vesicles they create an aqueous compartment which is well sparated of the exterior solution. Is important to note that these bilayers are permeable to uncharged molecules like $H_2O, O_2,$ etc, but do not allow the permation of larger ions or water soluble molecules such as glucose.
- Sa consequence these molecules act like active particles which exert a force onto the membrane.
- This force divided by some patch of the membrane is called [[osmotic pressure]] 
Indeed, [[osmotic pressure]] is the force to maintain equilibrium. 
The difference causes water to move through the memvrane into the compartment with the higher solute concentration. 

Example: Higher solute concentration in the exterior, this causes deinflation and the vesicle decrease it size until it matches the interior particle concentration. 

The opposite case when the vesicle increase size; is truncated by the ability of the mechanical properties of the membrane. 

## Fluidity of Biomembranes
An important point is that the shape transformation are possible only if the membrane is a 2-D liquid, reference [[seifert1997_Configurations of fluid membranes and vesicles]]
## Curvature of membranes

The emergence of curvature happens at the microscopic scale, in order to characterize a [[Lipid Bilayer Structure]] a coarse grained model is needed, that is, one has to consider small patches and average over the molecular conformation of the membrane.
