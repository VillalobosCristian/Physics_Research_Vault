![[Bilayer.excalidraw]]
The lipid bilayer is the simplest [[Biomimetic]] biomembrane, which can be composed of a single type of lipid. 
[[Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs)|GUVs]] can be visualized in their fluid state by microscopy.

When the bilayer form a vesicles they create an aqueous compartment which is well sparated of the exterior solution. Is important to note that these bilayers are permeable to uncharged molecules like $H_2O, O_2,$ etc, but do not allow the permation of larger ions or water soluble molecules such as glucose.
- Sa consequence these molecules act like active particles which exert a force onto the membrane.
- This force divided by some patch of the membrane is called [[osmotic pressure]]
