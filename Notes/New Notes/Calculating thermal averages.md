Whenever need to calculate the thermal averages of small-amplitude fluctuations we follows four rules:
- 1.- Write the free energy to quadratic order in the amplitude of the fluctuations. In the base state the energy is minimal, so there are no linear terms. 
- 2 .- Write the fluctuation amplitudes in terms of Fourier modes (or spherical modes for spherically symmetric problems), to find these diagonalize the free energy-in other words, differents modes are treated as independent, i.e. as uncoupled [[Gaussian variables]].
- 3.- Use equipartition of energy to calculate the thermal average of each mode: the average energy of each mode has energy $1/2 k_B T$. 
- 4. Revert to real space to calculate the thermal average of any quantity.
