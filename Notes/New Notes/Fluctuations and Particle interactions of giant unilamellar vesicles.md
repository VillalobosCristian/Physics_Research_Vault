We aim to investigate the shape fluctuations of GUVs using fluctuation spectroscopy. These fluctuations, driven by thermal perturbations, depend on the membrane’s bending rigidity $\kappa$ and tension $\sigma$.  They can be amplified by increase the temperature or by means of interaction with external objects such as passive colloidal particles.  Our goal is to develop a robust protocol to measure both the vesicle's shape fluctuations and its interaction with these particles.
