The idea is to study the shape fluctuations  of GUVs using fluctuation spectroscopy, this fluctuations arise from the thermal energy perturbing the membrane shape, which is governed by bending rigidity $\kappa$ and tension $\sigma$.  These fluctuations can be enhaced by increasing the temperature or by means of interaction with external objects such as passive particles. In this project we want to create a robust protocol which allows us to measure the shape fluctuations and the interaction vesicle-particle.


We aim to investigate the shape fluctuations of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) using 

fluctuation spectroscopy. These fluctuations, driven by thermal perturbations, depend on 

the membrane’s bending rigidity \(\kappa\) and tension \(\sigma\). They can be amplified 

by increasing the temperature or by introducing external objects such as passive particles. 

Our goal is to develop a robust protocol to measure both the vesicle’s shape fluctuations 

and its interactions with these particles.
