## 1. Methods for GUV Preparation

**Electroformation:** The most widely used method for GUV generation is electroformation, in which a thin lipid film (typically on conductive indium-tin oxide glass or platinum wires) swells into GUVs under an alternating electric field ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/lRmweAe4/#:~:text=36,827)). Electroformation efficiently produces many 10–50 μm unilamellar vesicles and can encapsulate solutes, but it traditionally requires low ionic strength (e.g. sugar solutions) to avoid electrolysis and is sensitive to lipid composition ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/lRmweAe4/#:~:text=38,giant%20unilamellar%20vesicles%20using%20interdigitated)). Recent optimizations have extended electroformation to harsher conditions – for example, using stainless steel electrodes or modified protocols to form vesicles in physiological saline and with charged or unsaturated lipids ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/lRmweAe4/#:~:text=38,giant%20unilamellar%20vesicles%20using%20interdigitated)). Electroformation can yield high-quality GUVs when lipids are in the fluid phase (thus often performed above the lipid melting temperature for saturated lipids). A drawback is that some lipid types (e.g. very asymmetric or charged lipids) may form defects or require careful tuning of voltage and frequency ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/lRmweAe4/#:~:text=40,phospholipid%20giant%20unilamellar%20vesicles%20in)).

**Natural Swelling (Film Hydration):** In simple hydration, dried lipid films on a substrate swell with an aqueous buffer to form vesicles. This method is gentle and does not require special equipment, but it often produces a mixture of GUVs and multilamellar vesicles ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=individual%20GVs,emulsion%20templating%20method%2C%20enables)). Yields of truly unilamellar vesicles by film hydration are typically lower than electroformation, and size dispersity is high. Nonetheless, it is useful for producing GUVs without electric fields – for example, when working with fragile compositions or when encapsulating sensitive biomolecules that might be affected by electroformation. Controlled humidity and inclusion of sugars (creating an osmotic imbalance that inflates vesicles) can improve yields. However, conventional hydration generally lacks control over vesicle size and usually results in heterogeneous populations ([Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=individual%20GVs,emulsion%20templating%20method%2C%20enables) ).

**Gel-Assisted Swelling:** Developed in the past decade, gel-assisted methods use a swollen polymer film (such as agarose or polyvinyl alcohol, PVA) as a substrate for lipid hydration ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=In%20these%20methods%2C%20polymer%20based,23%20%2C%2047) ) ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=This%20protocol%20is%20adapted%20and,3%20hours%20at%20room%20temperature) ). Lipids dried on a hydrated polymer gel experience facilitated water influx, promoting rapid GUV formation. The advantages are higher yield and the ability to form GUVs even in buffers with physiological salt, since the gel prevents lipids from adhering strongly to the solid substrate ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=In%20these%20methods%2C%20polymer%20based,23%20%2C%2047) ) ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=control%20method,However%2C%20since%20the) ). Agarose-assisted hydration and PVA-assisted hydration have both been successfully used; PVA in particular gives high yield within minutes ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=This%20protocol%20is%20adapted%20and,3%20hours%20at%20room%20temperature) ) ([Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=filled%20with%202%20ml%20of,like%20the%20spontaneous%20swelling%20method) ). These methods allow inclusion of biological polymers or salts that normally hinder electroformation. The trade-off is potential contamination of the GUV membrane with gel residues: studies have found that agarose or PVA can remain attached to or embedded in the bilayer, which may alter membrane properties (e.g. increasing membrane surface viscosity) ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=GUVs%20are%20more%20viscous%20%2836,also%20lead%20to%20extra%20dissipation) ) ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=SS%2025,2) ). In one comparative study, GUVs grown by agarose gel had significantly higher membrane viscosity than those from PVA or electroformation, indicating more severe polymer residue effects ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=GUVs%20are%20more%20viscous%20%2836,also%20lead%20to%20extra%20dissipation) ) ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=match%20at%20L729%20PTM%20,8) ). Nevertheless, gel-assisted methods are valued for their speed and robustness in physiological conditions ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=We%20chose%20spontaneous%20swelling%20as,ii%29%20might) ) ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=,method%20for%20GUVs%20in%20respect) ).

**Emulsion Phase-Transfer (Inverted Emulsion):** Emulsion-based methods create GUVs by forming water-in-oil droplets coated with a lipid monolayer, then pushing these droplets through an oil-water interface into an aqueous phase ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=%23%202.2.4.%20Phase) ). As a droplet crosses the interface, it acquires a second lipid monolayer from the interface, yielding a closed bilayer vesicle ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=The%20phase,9) ). This approach (also called phase-transfer or double emulsion) can directly encapsulate desired inner solutions (including high salt or macromolecules) with high efficiency ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=%23%202.2.4.%20Phase) ). It also offers control over size: for instance, microfluidic devices can produce monodisperse water-in-oil droplets, leading to uniform GUV diameters. The method’s major challenge is removing solvent/oil traces from the bilayer; even very thin oil residues can affect membrane thickness and leaflet coupling ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/lRmweAe4/#:~:text=vesicles%20is%20found%20consistent%20across,The)). Indeed, simulations suggest that residual oil from an emulsion method slightly increases the bilayer hydrophobic thickness and reduces coupling between leaflets, although experimental aspiration measurements indicate the bending elasticity is not substantially changed ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/lRmweAe4/#:~:text=vesicles%20is%20found%20consistent%20across,The)) ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/lRmweAe4/#:~:text=the%20inner%20leaflet%20poses%20challenges,membranes%20with%20higher%20compressibility%20modulus)). Another consideration is that some nominally “unilamellar” vesicles from emulsions may have a few closely spaced bilayers (reports found 2–3 lamellae in some cases) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=water,was%20found%20to%20be%202%E2%80%933) ) unless carefully optimized. Despite these caveats, phase-transfer methods have been key for encapsulating proteins, biomolecular networks, or colloidal particles inside GUVs, which is crucial for _in vitro_ synthetic biology applications. Newer implementations such as continuous droplet interface crossing (cDICE) use centrifugation to drive droplet transfer, enabling high-throughput production of loaded GUVs ([High-Speed Imaging of Giant Unilamellar Vesicle Formation in cDICE](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.4c04825#:~:text=High,sized%20containers%20in%20synthetic%20biology)) ([A Practical Guide to Preparation and Applications of Giant ... - MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0375/13/4/440#:~:text=Formed%20via%20Centrifugation%20of%20Water,Emulsion%20Droplets)).

**Microfluidic and Other Novel Techniques:** The quest for uniform and application-specific GUVs has spurred microfluidic innovations ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications | CoLab](https://colab.ws/articles/10.1016%2Fj.cis.2023.102935#:~:text=their%20applications,like%20phase%20separation%2C%20membrane%20protein)) ([Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=match%20at%20L401%20this%20is,apparatus%20for) ). Microfluidic emulsion generators can produce size-tunable GUVs with precise contents, improving reproducibility for drug delivery studies or artificial cell reactors ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=match%20at%20L401%20this%20is,apparatus%20for) ). Flow-focusing devices and jetting methods (e.g. acoustic or electric jetting of lipid-coated droplets) have emerged to form GUVs rapidly. For example, one approach uses pulsed jets to shoot lipid-coated nanodroplets into an aqueous phase, forming cell-sized vesicles in high salt environments ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=,Google%20Scholar) ). Other techniques include microinjection (directly injecting buffer into giant multilamellar liposomes to produce unilamellar structures) and freeze-thaw or detergent dilution protocols to unpack multilamellar vesicles, though these are less common for giant vesicles. Each method can bias the membrane properties: a comprehensive 2022 comparison found that spontaneous swelling and electroformation produce membranes with similar bending rigidity and electrical capacitance, whereas polymer-assisted and phase-transfer vesicles showed altered shear viscosities (due to polymer or solvent inclusion) ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=control%20method,However%2C%20since%20the) ) ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=all%20the%20preparation%20methods%2C%20we,biomolecules%20in%20synthetic%20cell%20studies) ). Thus, researchers must choose a preparation method appropriate for their desired lipid composition and experimental conditions. **Key point:** the preparation technique **dictates GUV yield, size distribution, and even membrane properties,** so one must weigh the pros and cons for a given application ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications | CoLab](https://colab.ws/articles/10.1016%2Fj.cis.2023.102935#:~:text=bottom,linking%2C%20and%20immobilization%20by%20microfluidic)) ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=control%20method,However%2C%20since%20the) ). Table 1 summarizes some typical outcomes: for instance, fluid-phase POPC vesicles made by electroformation or gentle hydration have bending moduli on the order of 25 _k__B_T_, whereas the same lipids via phase-transfer can exhibit similar bending rigidity but an order-of-magnitude higher surface viscosity due to residual solvent ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=SS%2025,2) ) ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=match%20at%20L729%20PTM%20,8) ).

**Influence of Lipid Composition and Environment:** Lipid makeup and buffer conditions strongly impact GUV formation success and quality. Cholesterol or other sterols, often included to tune membrane fluidity, generally integrate well up to ~30–40 mol% in electroformation and hydration protocols; they tend to increase membrane toughness but may slightly broaden the size distribution ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=using%20micropipette%20aspiration%2C%20different%20membrane,differential%20role%20in%20regulating%20membrane)). Highly charged lipids can pose challenges in electroformation (due to electrode adhesion or electrostatic repulsion preventing bilayer closure), but methods like gel-assisted swelling or using alternating current (AC) fields at high frequency can alleviate some issues ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/lRmweAe4/#:~:text=38,giant%20unilamellar%20vesicles%20using%20interdigitated)). Unsaturated lipids (e.g. DOPC) form GUVs readily, whereas very saturated lipids (e.g. DPPC) require heating above their Tm (>41 °C for DPPC) during formation to ensure the bilayer is fluid, otherwise vesicles may be defect-ridden or not form at all. Environmental factors are likewise critical: the presence of even modest salt (tens of mM) can drastically reduce electroformation yield because ions screen the applied field and can cause local pH changes. Gel-assisted and emulsion methods are preferable for making GUVs in physiological buffers (150 mM salt) or with biologically relevant crowded solutions ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=control%20method,However%2C%20since%20the) ) ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=,method%20for%20GUVs%20in%20respect) ). Osmotic conditions must be controlled to prevent vesicle collapse or excessive inflation; a slight osmotic pressure difference (e.g. internal sucrose vs external glucose) is often used so that GUVs are easier to see (they sediment and have refractive index contrast) and remain tense enough to be spherical. Overall, the last decade has seen _significant advances in GUV preparation,_ yielding more reliable protocols for difficult conditions and enabling GUVs with tailored sizes, compositions, and contents ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications | CoLab](https://colab.ws/articles/10.1016%2Fj.cis.2023.102935#:~:text=their%20applications,like%20phase%20separation%2C%20membrane%20protein)) ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications | CoLab](https://colab.ws/articles/10.1016%2Fj.cis.2023.102935#:~:text=addition%2C%20vesicles%20are%20also%20employed,potential%20techniques%20for%20dedicated%20applications)). However, **challenges remain** in achieving perfectly monodisperse and truly defect-free unilamellar vesicles at scale. New microfluidic and hybrid methods are actively being explored to address these limitations ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=match%20at%20L401%20this%20is,apparatus%20for) ) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=this%20is%20that%20conventional%20preparation,apparatus%20for) ).

## 2. Mechanical Properties of GUV Membranes

GUVs have been instrumental in characterizing the **mechanical properties** of lipid bilayers, such as bending rigidity, membrane tension, area expansion elasticity, and membrane viscosity (viscous dissipation within or between the leaflets). Because GUVs are large and observable, one can directly manipulate and deform them to measure force–deformation responses that reveal membrane material constants. Key mechanical parameters include:

- **Bending Rigidity (κ):** the energy cost to bend the membrane, typically on the order of 10^-19 J (tens of _k__B_T_ for a single-component fluid bilayer). For example, a fluid POPC bilayer at room temperature has κ ≈ 25 _k__B_T_ ([Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=SS%2025,2) ). Including cholesterol generally increases κ (stiffening the membrane), whereas unsaturated chains or charged lipids can decrease κ slightly by making the membrane more flexible. Experimentally, bending rigidity can be obtained by several methods. **Micropipette aspiration** is a classical technique: a single GUV is partially suctioned into a glass micropipette, and the relation between aspiration pressure and membrane curvature at the pipette tip is used to compute bending modulus and tension ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=properties%20measured%20by%20using%20micropipette,aspiration)) ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=match%20at%20L605%20Since%20the,role%20of%20increasing%20membrane%20tension)). Since the 1980s, numerous aspiration studies have measured bending moduli for different lipid compositions ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=match%20at%20L605%20Since%20the,role%20of%20increasing%20membrane%20tension)). An alternative is **fluctuation analysis** (flicker spectroscopy), where thermal shape undulations of a vesicle are tracked by video microscopy and analyzed via the Helfrich theory to extract κ. This noninvasive method, applied to GUVs in the last decade with high-resolution cameras, confirms bending rigidity values in line with aspiration and reveals how inclusions (e.g. proteins) alter κ ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=example%2C%20mechanical%20tests%20using%20micropipette,permease%20into%20the%20GUV%20bilayer)). A recent innovation even used super-resolution STED microscopy to observe nanotube diameters pulled from GUVs, allowing determination of membrane tension and bending stiffness at suboptical scales ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=,PMC%20free%20article) ). Generally, a bending rigidity of 20–40 _k__B_T_ is expected for one-component fluid bilayers; higher values (50–100 _k__B_T_) indicate a very rigid membrane (e.g. gel-phase or polymer-supported), while lower values occur in highly disordered or perforated membranes ( [Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=different%20properties%20such%20as%20bending,and%20surprisingly%2C%20some%20properties%20are) ).
    
- **Membrane Tension (σ):** a pre-tension or tension induced by stretching the vesicle. A free GUV in osmotic balance has near-zero tension (floppy membrane), but experimenters often impose a tension via aspiration or osmotic deflation. Membrane tension influences fluctuation amplitudes and the threshold for mechanical instability (rupture). Micropipette aspiration directly measures the lysis tension – the membrane tension at which the vesicle ruptures – typically on the order of 5–10 mN/m for fluid lipid bilayers ([Active probing of the mechanical properties of biological and ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304416519302752#:~:text=,135)). Controlled tension is also used to study pore formation: as tension rises, pores can open in the membrane. Recent studies using optical tweezers have shown that membrane nanotubes pulled from GUVs can serve as tension probes: the tube radius shrinks as σ increases, which can be imaged to back out the tension in the membrane ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=,PMC%20free%20article) ). Bending and tension jointly dictate vesicle shape; for instance, a nearly tension-free vesicle takes a fluctuating spherical shape, whereas under higher tension it becomes more taut and spherical, suppressing flicker. GUVs allow **dynamic tension changes** – e.g., by adjusting micropipette suction or osmotic conditions – to observe transitions like vesicle budding or splitting when tension and bending energy trade off ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=essential%20process%20using%20a%20minimal,moderate%20particle%20concentrations%2C%20we%20observed) ) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=leading%20to%20two%20distinct%20engulfment,highlighting%20how%20the%20interplay%20between) ).
    
- **Area Elasticity (Stretching Modulus, K_A):** Unlike bending (out-of-plane softness), this measures in-plane extensibility of the membrane area. Lipid bilayers are nearly incompressible in-plane, with a large stretching modulus (typically 0.2–0.3 N/m). This corresponds to only a few percent area strain at lysis. Aspiration experiments provide K_A by seeing how much additional area (drawn from thermal undulations) is mobilized under tension ( [Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=composition%2C%20they%20can%20also%20be,like%20membranes.%20By%20contrast) ) ( [Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=produces%20an%20unexpected%20softening%20of,properties%20of%20drug%20delivery%20vehicles) ). Pure lipid membranes have K_A determined by lipid chain elasticity; adding cholesterol usually increases K_A (makes membrane less area-compressible) ([Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=composition%2C%20they%20can%20also%20be,like%20membranes.%20By%20contrast) ). In contrast, incorporating protein channels or defects can lower the effective area stiffness by introducing slack. Although area elasticity is large, its effects are crucial when considering sound-speed in membranes or membrane compression in ultrasound contexts. In GUV studies, area dilation is often measured alongside bending; one study showed that tethering polymers to a GUV (see section 4) did not significantly change the area expansion modulus, even though it affected bending rigidity ( [Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=composition%2C%20they%20can%20also%20be,like%20membranes.%20By%20contrast) ) ([Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=produces%20an%20unexpected%20softening%20of,properties%20of%20drug%20delivery%20vehicles) ).
    
- **Membrane Viscosity:** Fluid membranes have an intrinsic two-dimensional viscosity and also experience inter-monolayer friction when the two leaflets slide past each other. These dissipative properties influence how fast a membrane returns to equilibrium after deformation. GUVs provide a platform to measure membrane viscosity by tracking the relaxation of deformed shapes or the diffusion of embedded tracers. For example, the decay rate of a thermally excited shape mode (captured by high-speed imaging) is related to membrane viscosity. Another approach is dragging a microsphere attached to the membrane with optical tweezers and measuring the drag force. Typical 2D viscosity of a lipid bilayer is ~10^-9–10^-8 N·s/m (in SI units) for fluid lipids, but it can increase dramatically if the membrane contains polymers or is in a gel phase. Indeed, one comparative experiment found that POPC GUVs made by phase-transfer (with residual solvent) had a **surface shear viscosity**~5× higher than those made by standard methods ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=EF%20%28Pt%29%2025,2) ) ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=GUVs%20are%20more%20viscous%20%2836,also%20lead%20to%20extra%20dissipation) ). This indicates contaminants can make membranes more viscous. In another study, adding an actin protein network to the external leaflet turned the membrane into a viscoelastic material with an effective 2D shear modulus on the order of 10^-6 N/m ( [Studying actin-induced cell shape changes using Giant Unilamellar Vesicles and reconstituted actin networks - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9704537/#:~:text=Helfer%20et%20al,a%202D%20shear%20modulus%20on) ) ( [Studying actin-induced cell shape changes using Giant Unilamellar Vesicles and reconstituted actin networks - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9704537/#:~:text=lipid%20membrane%20to%20100%E2%80%931000%20k_,strengthens%20the%20GUV%20membrane%20by) ). Generally, pure lipid GUV membranes have no static shear modulus (they flow like 2D liquids) ( [Studying actin-induced cell shape changes using Giant Unilamellar Vesicles and reconstituted actin networks - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9704537/#:~:text=lipid%20membrane%20to%20100%E2%80%931000%20k_,strengthens%20the%20GUV%20membrane%20by) ), but a finite viscosity means there is a time-dependent resistance to shear. Advanced techniques like dynamic surface laser scattering and AFM-based microrheology on GUVs are being developed to quantify membrane viscosity. This is an evolving area, with recent interest in how **membrane viscosity affects protein mobility and vesicle fusion rates** (a current research trend).
    

**Experimental Techniques:** Micropipette aspiration remains the gold standard for measuring bending modulus, area elasticity, and lysis tension in GUVs ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=match%20at%20L605%20Since%20the,role%20of%20increasing%20membrane%20tension)). It provides quantitative control of tension and direct visualization of deformation (the tongue length of vesicle aspirated into the pipette is measured to get area expansion) ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=properties%20measured%20by%20using%20micropipette,aspiration)) ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=match%20at%20L605%20Since%20the,role%20of%20increasing%20membrane%20tension)). **Atomic force microscopy (AFM)** can also probe mechanics by indenting surface-adhered GUVs: the AFM tip pushes on the vesicle and the force–distance curve reveals the membrane’s resistance (effective stiffness). AFM measurements of GUV mechanics have been less common, partly because of the difficulty of immobilizing delicate vesicles without bursting them ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=complexes%20,and%20area%20compressibility%20modulus%20using)). When successful, AFM allows mapping local stiffness or probing heterogeneities (e.g. domains vs fluid regions). However, limitations include the need for GUVs to be attached to a substrate (which may alter tension and curvature), and the long timescales of scanning which preclude dynamic measurements ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=shell%20GUVs%29%20%28Fig,measurement%20time%20are%20worth%20noting)). **Other methods** used to perturb or test GUV mechanics include electrodeformation (applying an AC electric field to stretch vesicles, useful for measuring bending modulus by the degree of deformation), optical stretching (using two opposing laser beams to stretch a vesicle), and acoustic deformation (using ultrasound to compress or oscillate vesicles) ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=1,76)) ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=using%20micropipette%20aspiration%2C%20different%20membrane,differential%20role%20in%20regulating%20membrane)). Each method has its niche: for instance, electrodeformation can rapidly screen mechanical effects of different compositions in parallel, and fluctuation analysis is completely non-contact. The combination of techniques has solidified key findings: **membrane elasticity is largely dictated by lipid composition and temperature**, and can be modulated by additives like cholesterol or proteins ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=example%2C%20mechanical%20tests%20using%20micropipette,permease%20into%20the%20GUV%20bilayer)) ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=using%20micropipette%20aspiration%2C%20different%20membrane,differential%20role%20in%20regulating%20membrane)). A current trend is studying membranes that mimic **cellular complexity** – for example, GUVs with membrane proteins, or a cytoskeletal cortex (see section 5) – to see how these components influence mechanical metrics. A remaining challenge is reconciling results from different methods (aspiration vs fluctuation spectroscopy can sometimes give slightly different κ values) and ensuring that preparation artifacts (like polymer or oil residues) are accounted for ([Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=control%20method,However%2C%20since%20the) ) ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=evidence%20that%20gel%20remnants%20or,our%20comparative%20conclusions%20regarding%20the) ). Nonetheless, GUV experiments over the last decade have greatly expanded our quantitative understanding of membrane mechanics in a regime directly relevant to cell-scale deformations.

## 3. GUV Interactions with Nano- and Microparticles

GUVs serve as simplified cell membrane models for studying how nanoparticles (NPs) and microparticles interact with lipid bilayers. Processes such as **adhesion, partial wrapping, full engulfment (endocytosis-like uptake)**, and even vesicle rupture induced by particles have been investigated using GUVs ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=membranes%20during%20endo,first) ) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=essential%20process%20using%20a%20minimal,by%20the%20interplay%20between%20membrane) ). A key finding is that particle-membrane interactions are governed by a balance of **adhesive energy vs membrane deformation energy** ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=essential%20process%20using%20a%20minimal,by%20the%20interplay%20between%20membrane) ) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=studies,29%2C16%20%2C%2031) ). When a particle binds to a membrane (via nonspecific interactions like electrostatic or hydrophobic attraction, or specific ligand-receptor binding), the membrane can wrap around it to gain adhesion energy, but this costs bending energy and can impose membrane tension. If the adhesive energy per area exceeds the bending energy penalty, the membrane will tend to engulf the particle; otherwise, the particle might only adhere weakly (or “surf” on the membrane without being swallowed) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=studies,29%2C16%20%2C%2031) ). This physical principle – often described by theoretical models based on minimizing the free energy – predicts critical conditions for engulfment.

**Particle Size:** There is a critical particle size above which full engulfment becomes energetically favorable (for a given adhesion strength and membrane rigidity). If particles are too small, the gain in adhesion area is small, and thermal forces can easily detach them; if they are too large, engulfment may stall as it requires creating a highly curved membrane around a big object. Theoretical studies have quantified this: for example, using continuum membrane models, Lipowsky and colleagues found a critical radius on the order of tens of nanometers for typical membrane parameters, beyond which vesicle uptake is expected ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=18.%20%20Agudo,Thermal%20fluctuations%20of) ). As a concrete result, **nanoparticles ~5–20 nm often adhere but do not wrap fully**, whereas micrometer-sized particles can be completely engulfed by GUVs, sometimes even leading to internalization into the vesicle lumen if the vesicle membrane fissions behind them (though scission usually does not occur spontaneously without protein machinery). Experimental work supports these thresholds: one study showed that ~500 nm particles were readily swallowed by GUVs, but ~100 nm particles mostly stuck partially wrapped on the exterior ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=18.%20%20Agudo,Thermal%20fluctuations%20of) ) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=studies,29%2C16%20%2C%2031) ). Membrane tension also influences the size threshold – higher tension makes it harder to wrap any particle, effectively shifting the threshold to smaller sizes (since even small curvatures are penalized by tension) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=leading%20to%20two%20distinct%20engulfment,highlighting%20how%20the%20interplay%20between) ).

**Particle Shape and Orientation:** A breakthrough in the last decade has been recognizing the importance of particle shape anisotropy. Non-spherical particles (rods, ellipsoids, discs, etc.) interact with membranes in more complex ways than spheres. Experiments with rod-shaped colloids and ellipsoidal particles show distinct **engulfment pathways**: a rod can insert **tip-first** or **side-first**, leading to different intermediate states ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=study%20aims%20to%20elucidate%20the,results%20are%20consistent%20with%20theoretical) ) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=aspect%20ratios,moderate%20particle%20concentrations%2C%20we%20observed) ). Recent work (Vutukuri _et al._, 2024) used fluorescent rod-like particles and GUVs to demonstrate two pathways – one where the rod’s end penetrates the membrane (tip-first) and one where the side of the rod adheres first – with the chosen path depending on membrane tension and rod aspect ratio ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=study%20aims%20to%20elucidate%20the,results%20are%20consistent%20with%20theoretical) ) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=leading%20to%20two%20distinct%20engulfment,highlighting%20how%20the%20interplay%20between) ). Side-first wrapping tends to initiate when tension is low and adhesion is strong, allowing the membrane to climb up the long side of the rod; tip-first is favored for high tension or high bending rigidity, where the membrane finds it easier to curve around a narrow end than along a broad side. **Orientation matters**: a particle oriented unfavorably might need to reorient before wrapping. This has parallels to biological phagocytosis where filamentous or shaped targets enter cells in specific orientations ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=,Google%20Scholar) ) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=25,Google%20Scholar) ). Computational models and simulations by Šarić _et al._ and others have mapped out state diagrams for anisotropic particle engulfment, showing how shape and initial orientation control whether a particle gets fully internalized or not ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=study%20aims%20to%20elucidate%20the,results%20are%20consistent%20with%20theoretical) ) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=aspect%20ratios,moderate%20particle%20concentrations%2C%20we%20observed) ). The consensus is that **spherical particles have the lowest wrapping energy barrier**, whereas elongated particles can trigger only partial wrapping unless certain conditions (like low tension) are met ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=essential%20process%20using%20a%20minimal,moderate%20particle%20concentrations%2C%20we%20observed) ). This explains why cells often take up spherical cargo more readily, and GUV experiments have quantified these effects in a controllable setting.

**Surface Properties:** The particle’s surface chemistry (charge, hydrophobicity, coating ligands) directly affects the adhesion energy. GUV studies have varied particle coatings to see how wrapping is altered. For instance, positively charged latex beads stick strongly to negatively charged lipid GUVs, often inducing full wrapping and even vesicle invagination if the charge is sufficiently high ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=studies,29%2C16%20%2C%2031) ). In contrast, neutral hydrophilic particles might not bind at all unless a specific ligand (like a cholesterol tag) inserts into the membrane. Janus particles – with two sides of differing chemistry – have been particularly insightful: one recent study used Janus microparticles half-coated with hydrophobic material. These particles were shown to **pin membranes** and even drag vesicles: the hydrophobic hemisphere would insert into the bilayer, effectively attaching the particle, while the hydrophilic side remained exposed ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=9,DOI) ). By applying magnetic or fluid forces on such Janus particles, researchers managed to move attached GUVs like “vesicle shuttles” ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=9,DOI) ). This demonstrates how surface properties can be tuned to achieve desired interactions (adhesive vs non-adhesive). Additionally, biofunctionalized surfaces (e.g. particles coated with cell-penetrating peptides or antibodies) have been tested on GUVs to model specific uptake pathways. For example, a 2014 study by Römer _et al._ showed that glyco-functionalized bacterial particles adhered to GUVs and induced **“lipid zipper”** wrapping – sequential adhesion of the membrane to the particle surface, much like a pathogen entering a cell ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=10,126%20Google) ). Such biomimetic experiments highlight that **specific binding can drive engulfment even for particles that would not wrap via generic interactions**, altering the physical criteria.

**Engulfment vs. Adhesion Outcomes:** Depending on the balance of forces, a particle in contact with a GUV might: (i) remain unbound (if no significant attraction), (ii) bind and sit on the membrane with minimal deformation (like a small indent), (iii) become partially wrapped (often a metastable state where the membrane covers >50% of the particle but cannot close the neck), or (iv) become fully wrapped (engulfed into the vesicle). GUV studies have visualized all these scenarios. Partial wrapping is common for large particles when membrane tension is present – the membrane forms a cup around the particle but cannot complete the engulfment because that would require creating a narrow membrane neck with high curvature. Theory indicates a **stable partial-wrapped state** can occur when adhesion and bending energies are balanced such that the last step (closure) is unfavorable ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=essential%20process%20using%20a%20minimal,by%20the%20interplay%20between%20membrane) ) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=,Google%20Scholar) ). Indeed, experiments see particles stuck in “half engulfed” states unless an external trigger (e.g. lowering tension or an enzymatic scission mimetic) is applied. Fully wrapped particles inside GUVs have been achieved in low-tension conditions; however, GUVs lack endocytic proteins to cut off the wrapped bud, so often the particle remains attached via a narrow neck. In some cases, gentle agitation or an extra adhesion boost can cause the neck to slip and the particle to detach inside.

**Multiple Particles and Cooperative Effects:** At moderate particle concentrations, GUVs can interact with several particles at once. Interestingly, membrane-mediated interactions can cause particles on a vesicle to attract each other – when one particle is partially wrapped, it creates local curvature that can deform the membrane in a way that favors another particle coming nearby ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=14,Soft%20Matter%202021%2C%2017%2C%203533%E2%80%933549) ). Experiments with rod clusters on GUVs showed that rods sometimes wrapped sequentially in clusters, suggesting a cooperative effect ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=pathway,can%20influence%20the%20engulfment%20pathway) ). Theoretical work (Saric & Cacciuto 2012) predicted that membranes can drive lateral aggregation of adsorbed spheres as they indent the membrane ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=,Google%20Scholar) ). This was later observed as patterned particle assemblies on GUVs. On the other hand, too many particles binding can also **collapse the vesicle or rupture it** if the adhesive area grows huge (since the membrane reservoir is finite). Researchers have used GUVs to study such **particle-induced vesicle rupture** as a model of drug carriers unloading: high-density binding of cationic nanoparticles, for instance, can cause vesicles to burst and release contents ([Processes and mechanisms underlying burst of giant unilamellar ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005273624000610#:~:text=,the%20main%20mechanisms%20underlying)).

Overall, **GUV experiments over the last decade have elucidated how physical parameters (particle size, shape, stiffness, surface chemistry) influence membrane wrapping and uptake**. They validate many theoretical predictions of wrapping physics ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=studies,29%2C16%20%2C%2031)) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=18.%20%20Agudo,Thermal%20fluctuations%20of) ) and bridge to biological endocytosis by providing a controllable membrane target. Current research trends include studying **active particles** (which exert forces on the membrane – e.g. light-activated or chemically propelled particles) and how they deform GUVs ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=6,Martin%20C.%3B%20Feofilova%20M.%3B%20Eisentraut) ) ([Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=7,2020%2C%20125%2C%20198102) ), as well as exploring **membrane asymmetry** (different lipids in inner vs outer leaflet) on wrapping, since cell membranes are asymmetric ([Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=18.%20%20Agudo,Thermal%20fluctuations%20of) ) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=19.%20%20Agudo,Google%20Scholar) ). A remaining challenge is to incorporate fission machinery or mimics so that GUVs can truly internalize particles as cells do – one approach uses optical tweezers to pinch off wrapped particles from the GUV ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=inside%2C%20which%20is%20often%20used,In%20contrast%2C%20Lobovkina%E2%80%99s%20group%20reported) ) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=with%20the%20counter%20electrode%20and,In%20addition%2C%20microinjection%20is%20also) ), and another uses membrane-active peptides to induce neck scission after wrapping. Combining these approaches will further our understanding of endocytic processes and nanocarrier design.

## 4. Polymer–Membrane Interactions

Polymers interact with lipid membranes in diverse ways, from adsorbing onto the membrane surface to inserting into the bilayer or even forming mixed polymer-lipid membranes. Studies with GUVs have been pivotal in understanding these interactions. Broadly, two scenarios are considered: **(a)** water-soluble polymers (or biopolymers) adsorbing or **tethered** to the membrane, and **(b)** **hybrid membranes** composed of a mix of lipids and synthetic polymer amphiphiles. Both can significantly alter membrane behavior.

**Polymer Adsorption & Tethering:** When polymers bind to the exterior of a vesicle, they can induce physical changes such as membrane bending, reduced fluctuation amplitude, or bridging between vesicles. A classic example is _polyethylene glycol_ (PEG), a neutral hydrophilic polymer often grafted to lipids to form a polymer brush on the vesicle surface (as in PEGylated liposomes for drug delivery). Low fractions of PEG-lipids in GUVs produce a steric stabilization effect – PEG chains repel each other and prevent vesicle-vesicle adhesion or coalescence. Interestingly, recent work shows that grafted polymers can also modify mechanical properties: one study tethered long-chain PEG (via a cholesterol anchor) to GUVs and found **no significant change in stretching modulus**, but when a bulky polysaccharide (chondroitin sulfate) was anchored instead, the membrane became softer ( [Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=composition%2C%20they%20can%20also%20be,like%20membranes.%20By%20contrast) ) ( [Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=,properties%20of%20drug%20delivery%20vehicles) ). Specifically, binding ~5 mol% of chondroitin to the outer leaflet of a fluid GUV reduced the area expansion modulus and bending stiffness, making the vesicle more floppy ( [Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=composition%2C%20they%20can%20also%20be,like%20membranes.%20By%20contrast) ) ( [Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=,properties%20of%20drug%20delivery%20vehicles) ). This was somewhat unexpected, as many had assumed adding an external polymer coat would stiffen the membrane by forming a “gel-like” layer. The result suggests that polysaccharides (which are highly charged and hydrated) can **screen lipid-lipid interactions or induce local curvature** that increases membrane flexibility ( [Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=essential%20in%20determining%20cell%20response,to%20target%20specific%20cell%20types) ) ( [Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=vesicle%20stability%2C%20but%20the%20use,potential%20means%20to%20study%20membrane) ). By contrast, PEG (uncharged, flexible) did not soften the membrane in that study, indicating that polymer structure and how it couples to the lipid headgroups are important. These findings mimic the effect of a cell’s glycocalyx (sugar chains on the membrane) on membrane mechanics ( [Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=Polysaccharides%20are%20a%20fundamental%20component,It%20may%20also%20be%20of) ) ( [Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=binding%20polysaccharides%20to%20the%20outer,to%20target%20specific%20cell%20types) ). Other polymer interactions include **polyelectrolyte adsorption**: for instance, poly-L-lysine (a cationic polymer) will adsorb to negatively charged GUVs and can cause vesicle aggregation and even fusion by bridging membranes. At high coverage, such polycations can condense the membrane (reducing its area as charges neutralize) and eventually cause collapse or pore formation due to strong adhesion. Fluorescence microscopy on GUVs has visualized how poly-L-lysine binding can trigger membrane tubulation and peeling, as the polymer sequesters anionic lipids and creates adhesive zones that pull membrane inward (a process relevant to DNA-lipid complexes as well) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=Scholar%20scholar.google.com%20,PubMed) ) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=27,Google%20Scholar) ). Another interesting case is **depletion attraction**: adding non-binding polymers like dextran or PEG to the external solution can induce vesicle adhesion via the depletion effect (polymers in solution prefer to stay out of the gap between two nearby vesicles, creating an osmotic pressure pushing them together) ([Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=stretching%20modulus%2C%20i,resistance%20to%20bending)). GUVs in phase-separated polymer solutions (e.g. PEG/dextran aqueous two-phase systems) experience complex shape changes as one polymer preferentially partitions inside or outside the vesicle ([Giant Vesicles Exposed to Aqueous Two‐Phase Systems ...](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/admi.201600451#:~:text=Giant%20Vesicles%20Exposed%20to%20Aqueous,These%20solutions%20undergo%20phase)). Reviews in the last decade have covered GUVs in such polymer-rich environments, noting that osmotic stresses and polymer partitioning can lead to budding or multilobed vesicle morphologies as the membrane tries to minimize free energy ([Giant Vesicles Exposed to Aqueous Two‐Phase Systems ...](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/admi.201600451#:~:text=Giant%20Vesicles%20Exposed%20to%20Aqueous,These%20solutions%20undergo%20phase)). In summary, **exogenous polymers can either stabilize membranes (steric or electrostatic repulsion preventing contacts) or destabilize them (bridging or curvature induction)**, and GUV experiments provide direct visualization of these effects.

**Hybrid Polymer–Lipid Membranes:** An exciting development in membrane science is the creation of **hybrid vesicles**containing both lipids and amphiphilic block copolymers in one bilayer ([Membrane composition of polymer-lipid hybrid vesicles](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352940722001846#:~:text=vesicles%20www,alternative%20to%20liposomes%20and%20polymersomes)) ([High Resolution Membrane Structures within Hybrid Lipid‐Polymer ...](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smll.202206267#:~:text=,applications%20in%20science%20and%20technology)). Block copolymers such as PDMS-g-PEO or PMOXA-PDMS-PMOXA (to name two common examples) can self-assemble into polymersomes (pure polymer vesicles) with much thicker membranes (~10–20 nm thick) than lipid bilayers (~4–5 nm) ([Polymer Vesicles and Lipid Nanoparticles - Annual Reviews](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-matsci-080222-105636#:~:text=Polymer%20Vesicles%20and%20Lipid%20Nanoparticles,is%20attributed%20to%20the%20larger)) ([Hybrid Unilamellar Vesicles of Phospholipids and Block Copolymers ...](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/12/6/1232#:~:text=Hybrid%20Unilamellar%20Vesicles%20of%20Phospholipids,thickness%20mismatch%20of%20the)). By mixing such polymers with phospholipids, one can form **large unilamellar hybrid vesicles** that combine properties of both constituents. Chemically, these hybrid membranes can phase-separate if the polymer and lipid are not fully miscible, leading to **domains** of polymer-rich and lipid-rich areas within the same membrane ([Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=displays%20synergistic%20properties%20not%20seen,new%20supramolecular%20systems%20and%20applications) ) ( [Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=Graphical%20Abstract) ). This lateral phase separation can even stack across bilayers in multilayer systems, creating novel 3D structures ( [Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=displays%20synergistic%20properties%20not%20seen,new%20supramolecular%20systems%20and%20applications)). Functionally, hybrids tend to be **mechanically robust** like polymersomes but also retain **biofunctionality** of lipids (such as fluidity and the ability to reconstitute membrane proteins) ( [Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=Synthetic%20block%20copolymers%20capture%20many,dimensional) ) ([Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=different%20properties%20such%20as%20bending,and%20surprisingly%2C%20some%20properties%20are) ). For example, pure polymer membranes have bending rigidities orders of magnitude higher than liposomes (they are very stiff), but adding lipids lowers the overall bending modulus into a more physiological range, while still being tougher than a fragile pure lipid vesicle. One recent report demonstrated **“membrane reinforcement”** by incorporating just 10–20% of a diblock copolymer into a POPC lipid membrane, which dramatically increased the vesicle’s tolerance to mechanical stress (the hybrid vesicles resisted rupture at tensions that burst pure liposomes) ([Membrane reinforcement in giant hybrid polymer lipid vesicles ...](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/sm/d0sm01581d#:~:text=,vesicles%20with%20unprecedented%20membrane%20toughness)). Meanwhile, the lipid component ensures the membrane remains fluid and is capable of hosting membrane proteins (which often don’t fold properly in purely synthetic polymer bilayers). Hybrids have shown **synergistic properties**: one group found that certain lipid-polymer combos lead to membranes that self-assemble into multi-layered onion-like structures with correlated domains, enhancing the **permeability** for encapsulated drug release ( [Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=biosensors%2C%20and%20artificial%20cells%20often,the%20results%20to%20raise%20new) ) ( [Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=displays%20synergistic%20properties%20not%20seen,new%20supramolecular%20systems%20and%20applications) ). Another study reported that hybrid GUVs can undergo repeatable **fusion and fission** events more easily than pure polymersomes, potentially useful for mimicking cell-like dynamics ([Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20hybrid%20vesicles%20can%3A%20,delivery%2C%2032%E2%80%9324%20field%20effect%20transistors) ).

**Effects on Membrane Mechanics and Structure:** Because polymers in hybrids are much thicker and often more rigid, they can **increase the bending modulus** and stretching modulus of the membrane. Indeed, hybrid vesicles can be “tuned” by polymer content: a higher fraction of polymer typically yields a higher bending rigidity and lower fluidity. However, an intriguing phenomenon is the possibility of **demixing** under stress – if a hybrid membrane is bent, the stiff polymer might concentrate on the flatter regions while lipids concentrate in the highly curved regions, effectively creating curvature-induced compositional gradients (this is a current topic of simulation work). Experimentally, fluorescence labeling has shown that polymer-rich domains tend to exclude very curved membrane nanotubes, which are pulled more easily from lipid-rich regions. Membrane viscosity in hybrids can also be high, reflecting the slower diffusion of polymer chains compared to lipids ( [Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=different%20properties%20such%20as%20bending,and%20surprisingly%2C%20some%20properties%20are) ). Despite these differences, many hybrids remain one-phase and homogeneous under certain compositions, giving a single mixed membrane. Large hybrid unilamellar vesicles (LHUVs) have been prepared with various polymer molecular weights, and surprisingly homogeneous mixing was observed even for long polymer chains, indicating favorable mixing enthalpy in some systems ([Large hybrid Polymer/Lipid Unilamellar vesicle (LHUV) at the ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021979721010572#:~:text=Large%20hybrid%20Polymer%2FLipid%20Unilamellar%20vesicle,from%202500%20to%204000%20g%2Fmol)) ([Large hybrid Polymer/Lipid Unilamellar vesicle (LHUV) at the ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021979721010572#:~:text=We%20show%20that%20hybrid%20vesicles,from%202500%20to%204000%20g%2Fmol)).

**Applications of Polymer–Lipid Systems:** By combining components, polymer–lipid hybrid vesicles have been proposed as next-generation drug delivery carriers and **artificial cells**. They offer the **stability of polymersomes**(which can persist in the bloodstream without leaking) along with the **biological functionality of liposomes** (such as fusogenicity or the ability to interact with cell membranes) ( [Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=synthetic%20or%20biological%20soft%20materials,Specific%20examples) ) ( [Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=different%20properties%20such%20as%20bending,and%20surprisingly%2C%20some%20properties%20are) ). For example, hybrid vesicles have been shown to be more robust against surfactant (bile salt) attack than liposomes, which could be useful for oral drug delivery in the digestive tract. Hybrids have also been used to create **supported hybrid bilayers** on solid substrates that are much tougher than supported lipid bilayers, allowing incorporation of pore-forming proteins without the membrane rupturing ( [Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20hybrid%20vesicles%20can%3A%20,delivery%2C%2032%E2%80%9324%20field%20effect%20transistors) ) ( [Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=distribution%20of%20different%20constituents%20of,delivery%2C%2032%E2%80%9324%20field%20effect%20transistors) ). As a specific case, one study demonstrated a hybrid membrane for biosensing: a block copolymer provided stability while lipid domains hosted ion channels; the resulting membrane could sustain electrical recording for longer durations than a pure lipid membrane which tended to break ( [Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20hybrid%20vesicles%20can%3A%20,delivery%2C%2032%E2%80%9324%20field%20effect%20transistors) ).

In summary, **polymer–membrane interactions can range from loose adsorption to fully integrated hybrid membranes**, each with distinct effects on membrane physical properties. Key findings in the last decade include the realization that **membrane-tethered polymers (synthetic or biopolymers) can modulate membrane mechanics in complex ways – sometimes stiffening, sometimes softening the membrane ( [Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=composition%2C%20they%20can%20also%20be,like%20membranes.%20By%20contrast) ) ( [Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=,properties%20of%20drug%20delivery%20vehicles) )** – and that creating hybrid polymer-lipid vesicles yields membranes with **synergistic properties not attainable by either component alone ( [Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=Synthetic%20block%20copolymers%20capture%20many,dimensional) ) ( [Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=different%20properties%20such%20as%20bending,and%20surprisingly%2C%20some%20properties%20are) )**. Current research is extending these concepts by using stimulable polymers (responsive to pH, light, etc.) to make “smart” GUVs whose properties can be switched, and by mimicking the cell glycocalyx with polymer coats on GUVs to study cell adhesion and signaling in a controlled way. The main challenges lie in controlling the distribution of polymers (avoiding uncontrolled domain formation when not desired) and ensuring biocompatibility for applications. Nonetheless, polymer–lipid GUV systems are a powerful platform combining the worlds of soft polymer physics and lipid biology.

## 5. Applications of GUVs in Biophysical and Synthetic Biology Studies

Giant unilamellar vesicles have become indispensable as **model membranes** and minimal cell prototypes in a variety of applications. We highlight several key areas:

**Membrane Biophysics and Phase Behavior:** GUVs provide a direct window into fundamental membrane phenomena such as lipid phase separation, domain formation (rafts), and curvature-driven shape changes. Because GUVs are optically large, one can observe coexisting liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domains when cholesterol and phase-separating lipids are present, producing visible patchy patterns akin to “raft” domains on cell membranes. Researchers use GUVs to study line tension between domains and how that affects budding – for instance, domains will sometimes bud off a GUV to minimize line energy. GUVs have been used to map out phase diagrams of multi-component lipid mixtures under microscopy. Another biophysical process accessible in GUVs is **membrane curvature generation and sensing**. Curvature-inducing proteins (like BAR domains, amphipathic helices, etc.) can be added to GUVs to see how they tubulate or deform the membrane, directly visualizing membrane remodeling that in cells leads to tubules or vesicles. Membrane elasticity theory (Helfrich model) has been validated by such experiments, confirming that cells likely exploit similar physics in vivo ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=,8.%20%5BDOI%5D%20%5BPMC%20free%20article) ) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=5,Dutto%20A)). In one example, adding an asymmetric lipid (lysolipid) to only the outer leaflet of a GUV caused it to invaginate inward, demonstrating how **lipid asymmetry can drive membrane bending** ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=18.%20%20Agudo,Thermal%20fluctuations%20of) ) – a model for how cells can bud vesicles by flipping lipids from one leaflet to the other.

**Protein–Membrane Interactions:** Many membrane proteins have been reconstituted into GUVs to study their function in a cell-sized context. Compared to small vesicles, GUVs allow direct visualization of protein distribution and even mechanical manipulation of protein-bearing membranes. For instance, ion channels reconstituted in GUVs have been studied using electrophysiological approaches combined with fluorescence to see how they cluster or how their activity changes membrane tension. GUVs are large enough to patch-clamp in some cases ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=this%20is%20that%20conventional%20preparation,apparatus%20for) ) or to observe conformational changes via optical microscopy. A notable application is the study of **membrane-sculpting proteins** like dynamin, coatomer, or ESCRT-III: these proteins can be added to GUVs to observe how they cause the vesicle to bud or divide. In the last decade, experiments have shown dynamin protein polymerizing around the neck of GUV buds and severing them (mimicking endocytic scission), and ESCRT proteins assembling on GUVs to pinch inward buds, directly visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Membrane **binding domains** (like PH domains that bind specific phosphoinositides) have also been studied on GUVs to see how peripheral proteins attach and generate targeting specificity. One powerful combination is using **GUVs with controlled lipid composition** to test a protein’s binding preference or enzymatic activity – e.g., kinase enzymes that act on lipids have been incorporated to watch them modify the membrane in real time. As a specific example of protein-membrane interaction gleaned from GUVs: a PNAS 2014 study by Eierhoff _et al._ reconstituted receptor glycolipids in GUVs and showed that certain bacterial lectins trigger a **zipper-like engulfment** of the bacterium into the GUV, purely through lipid-based adhesion ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=10,126%20Google) ). This provided a model for pathogen entry independent of protein receptors.

**Synthetic Biology and Artificial Cells:** GUVs are a cornerstone in bottom-up synthetic biology, acting as **cell-like containers** for assembling minimal life-like systems ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications | CoLab](https://colab.ws/articles/10.1016%2Fj.cis.2023.102935#:~:text=electric%2C%20and%20magnetic%20barriers,potential%20techniques%20for%20dedicated%20applications)). Researchers have packed GUVs with transcription-translation machinery to create cell-free expression systems inside lipid vesicles, effectively making a simplified cell that can produce proteins ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=conversion%20capabilities%20of%20proteins%2C%20in,years%20to%20imitate%20cellular%20functions) ) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=recent%20years%20to%20imitate%20cellular,functions) ). One milestone was the synthesis of an enzyme within a GUV that then carried out a reaction inside – a step toward artificial cell “metabolism”. GUVs have also been used to emulate cell signaling: for example, putting membrane-bound kinases and G-proteins in a GUV membrane and observing signal transduction cascades upon adding an external ligand. Because GUVs can compartmentalize reactions, multiple GUVs have been fused to mix contents in a controlled way ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=fact%20that%20optical%20tweezers%20exert,92) ) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=successfully%20collected%20multiple%20GUVs%20with,92) ), enabling sequential enzymatic pathways to be executed (Elani _et al._, 2018 used optical tweezers to bring GUVs together and induce fusion between specific ones to simulate a two-step reaction factory ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=fact%20that%20optical%20tweezers%20exert,90%5D.%20Shiomi) ) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=using%20an%20optical%20tweezer%20inside,gradient%20of%20the%20force%20of) )). Another frontier is **vesicle division and growth**: significant progress has been made in inducing GUVs to grow (by feeding them additional lipids) and divide (through mechanical or chemical means), aiming to recapitulate the cell cycle in a minimal system ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=proteins%2C%20DNA%2C%20and%20RNA%2C%20have,33%2C15%20%2C%2035%2C17%20%2C%2037) ) ([Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=proliferation%20of%20the%20membrane%20itself,14%20%2C%2034%2C16%20%2C%2036%2C18) ). For instance, some GUVs have been engineered to undergo rudimentary division when osmotic shocks or contractile protein rings (like actomyosin, see below) are applied ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=contact%20with%20each%20other%2C%20and,92) ) ([Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=enzymatic%20reaction%20inside%20the%20partially,micrometer) ). These synthetic cell models highlight the versatility of GUVs: they can be _sensors_ (detecting environmental signals and producing a readout), _processors_ (carrying out logical or chemical reactions), or _actuators_ (exerting forces, as with motor proteins) ([Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=supramolecular%20chemistry%20for%20understanding%20cellular,33%2C15%20%2C%2035%2C17%20%2C%2037) ). Indeed, GUV-based “devices” with higher-order functions have been demonstrated, such as vesicles that release a signal in response to DNA detection (a mock cell-cell communication) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=supramolecular%20chemistry%20for%20understanding%20cellular,33%2C15%20%2C%2035%2C17%20%2C%2037)).

**Drug and Toxin Testing (Membrane Permeabilization Assays):** GUVs offer a visible assay for how drugs, peptides, or other compounds affect membranes. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), for example, are thought to kill bacteria by disrupting their membranes. GUVs composed of bacterial lipid mixtures have been used as targets to directly watch peptide-induced damage. Under fluorescence microscopy, one can see an AMP like melittin or magainin cause GUVs to leak (dye leaves the interior) or burst altogether ([Single giant unilamellar vesicle method reveals effect of ... - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16313185/#:~:text=PubMed%20pubmed,of%20large%20unilamellar%20vesicles)) ([Antimicrobial peptide magainin 2-induced rupture of single giant ...](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36567034/#:~:text=Antimicrobial%20peptide%20magainin%202,the%20internal%20cell%20contents%2C)). Because GUVs are large, partial perturbations can be observed: some AMPs cause transient pore opening (flashes of content release) before complete rupture. By analyzing many GUVs, researchers determine the peptide concentration at which most vesicles burst – effectively measuring the lytic efficiency. Similarly, **detergents and surfactants** have been tested on GUVs to study mechanisms of membrane solubilization. Low detergent levels may cause GUVs to form transient perforations or buds, while high levels dissolve the membrane into mixed micelles. A 2020 study visualized how a model detergent gradually thins the GUV membrane (seen by increased flicker) until a critical point where the vesicle suddenly collapses. Such **membrane stress assays** on GUVs are useful for evaluating drug candidates (e.g. whether a new peptide drug targets bacterial-like membranes selectively) and for fundamental understanding of lysis processes ([[PDF] Spectroscopic and Microscopic Approaches for ... - Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medical-technology/articles/10.3389/fmedt.2020.628552/pdf#:~:text=This%20assay%20relies%20on%20the,model%20antimicrobial%20peptide%20in)) ([Measuring thousands of single vesicle leakage events reveals the ...](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.13.455434v1.full-text#:~:text=,peptides%20with%20a%20high)).

**Cytoskeletal Interactions:** A very active area is reconstructing parts of the cytoskeleton on GUV membranes to investigate how the cytoskeleton influences membrane shape and mechanics. Actin filament networks have been polymerized either inside GUVs (pushing on the membrane from within) or on the cytosolic face of GUV membranes (as an attached cortical shell). These _in vitro_ cortices have yielded insights into cell cortex function. For example, actin polymerization on the inner leaflet of GUVs can drive spontaneous **polar shape changes** – GUVs form a single bleb or asymmetric protrusion when an actomyosin network contracts on one side ([Capping protein-controlled actin polymerization shapes lipid ...](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03918-1#:~:text=Capping%20protein,cortices%20are%20capable%20to)) ([Encapsulated actomyosin patterns drive cell-like membrane shape ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004222005065#:~:text=Encapsulated%20actomyosin%20patterns%20drive%20cell,of%20actomyosin%20ring%20and)). By adjusting actin crosslinkers and myosin motor activity, researchers reproduced features like cortex tension and observed how a stronger cortex prevents membrane thermal fluctuations and raises the apparent rigidity of the vesicle ( [Studying actin-induced cell shape changes using Giant Unilamellar Vesicles and reconstituted actin networks - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9704537/#:~:text=Helfer%20et%20al,a%202D%20shear%20modulus%20on) ) ( [Studying actin-induced cell shape changes using Giant Unilamellar Vesicles and reconstituted actin networks - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9704537/#:~:text=energy%20to%20pay%20to%20change,strengthens%20the%20GUV%20membrane%20by) ). In one striking experiment, an actin coat bound to a GUV via biotin-streptavidin was shown to increase the bending modulus of the membrane by an order of magnitude (from ~10 _k__B_T_ to 100–1000 _k__B_T_) ( [Studying actin-induced cell shape changes using Giant Unilamellar Vesicles and reconstituted actin networks - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9704537/#:~:text=Helfer%20et%20al,a%202D%20shear%20modulus%20on) ) ( [Studying actin-induced cell shape changes using Giant Unilamellar Vesicles and reconstituted actin networks - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9704537/#:~:text=transverse%20thermal%20fluctuations%20by%20increasing,strengthens%20the%20GUV%20membrane%20by) ). The actin network also introduced an elastic shear resistance (solid-like behavior) to the otherwise fluid membrane ( [Studying actin-induced cell shape changes using Giant Unilamellar Vesicles and reconstituted actin networks - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9704537/#:~:text=transverse%20thermal%20fluctuations%20by%20increasing,strengthens%20the%20GUV%20membrane%20by) ). This directly demonstrates how the cell’s cortex can stiffen the cell membrane and resist deformation. Microtubules have similarly been reconstituted in GUVs (often to study how elongated microtubules can press against the membrane to form tubule-like protrusions, relevant to processes like mitotic spindle pushing on the cell boundary). Another aspect is **motor proteins** generating forces: myosin motors in an actin gel on a GUV can cause dramatic shape oscillations – a recent work formed a minimal actomyosin cortex on GUVs that exhibited pulsatile contractions, reminiscent of cellular blebbing cycles ([Myosin-II activity generates a dynamic steady state with continuous ...](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30538127/#:~:text=,II%20activity)) ([Branched actin cortices reconstituted in vesicles sense membrane ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349523001248#:~:text=Branched%20actin%20cortices%20reconstituted%20in,We%20used%20a%20modified)). Such models are shedding light on how cells control shape and morphology via the interplay of membranes and internal force-generating machinery. The **challenge** remains to incorporate multiple cytoskeletal components and signaling pathways to get closer to real cell behavior, but step by step, GUV-based reconstitutions are providing a quantitative testbed for cell biology.

In summary, **GUV applications span from basic biophysical research to prototyping of cell-like systems**. Key findings include confirming theoretical models of membrane domain behavior, revealing how specific proteins and peptides alter membranes, and achieving rudimentary cell functions (gene expression, division, signaling) in artificial cells ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications | CoLab](https://colab.ws/articles/10.1016%2Fj.cis.2023.102935#:~:text=electric%2C%20and%20magnetic%20barriers,potential%20techniques%20for%20dedicated%20applications)) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=proteins%2C%20DNA%2C%20and%20RNA%2C%20have,33%2C15%20%2C%2035%2C17%20%2C%2037) ). Current trends are pushing toward _more complex GUV-based systems_ – e.g. multi-compartment vesicles (one vesicle inside another to mimic organelles) ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications | CoLab](https://colab.ws/articles/10.1016%2Fj.cis.2023.102935#:~:text=electric%2C%20and%20magnetic%20barriers,potential%20techniques%20for%20dedicated%20applications)), vesicles with membrane-bound DNA origami structures to emulate protein coats, and high-throughput assays of thousands of GUVs at once for drug screening. A remaining challenge is **stability and longevity** of these models: keeping GUVs intact and functional over long periods (days) is non-trivial, as they can fuse or lose encapsulated components over time. Encapsulating crowding agents or cytosolic simulants is being tried to make the interior of GUVs more cell-like. Despite challenges, the versatility of GUVs ensures they will continue to be a central platform for bridging chemistry, biology, and materials science in the quest to understand and build cellular systems.

## 6. Imaging Techniques for GUVs

Because of their cell-like dimensions, GUVs are ideally suited to **optical microscopy**, which has been the primary tool to observe and characterize them. A range of microscopy modalities are used, each with advantages and limitations:

- **Bright-Field Microscopy:** In standard transmitted light, GUVs can be seen if there is sufficient refractive index contrast between the interior and exterior solution (for example, if the GUV interior contains sucrose and the exterior contains glucose, the vesicle appears as a faint sphere under bright-field due to light refraction at the curved interface). However, the thin lipid membrane (5 nm thick) itself is practically invisible in bright-field. Unstained GUVs may be detected by phase effects or by encapsulating some colored solution or particles that provide contrast ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=dark,field) ) ([Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=result%2C%20it%20is%20possible%20to,powerful%20tool%20for%20observing%20GVs) ). Generally, bright-field alone is not the best for GUV membrane visualization, but it is useful to locate vesicles and to observe gross changes like vesicle bursting or aggregation. Some studies use colorimetric indicators inside GUVs (e.g., a pH-sensitive dye that changes color if a GUV leaks protons) which can be read out in bright-field images.
    
- **Phase-Contrast Microscopy:** Phase-contrast optics convert phase shifts (due to the light passing through the vesicle) into intensity differences, making transparent objects like GUVs visible as outlined halos. This is a classical method to observe GUVs without fluorescent dyes ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=characterized%20as%20a%20%E2%80%9Cvesicles,The%20stained%20GVs%20are) ). Phase-contrast is especially good for visualizing **thin membranes or nearly transparent structures**: a properly focused phase image shows a GUV as a dark or bright halo outlining the spherical membrane. One limitation is the “phase halo” effect – multiple concentric halos can appear for multilamellar vesicles, and very thick-walled vesicles cause strong artifacts. Phase-contrast works best for giant _uni_lamellar vesicles (single bilayer) because the single membrane produces a clean edge with minimal halo ([Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=characterized%20as%20a%20%E2%80%9Cvesicles,The%20stained%20GVs%20are) ). If a GUV has several concentric shells (like an onion vesicle), phase-contrast can produce multiple rings and obscure the image. Thus, phase-contrast is often used after preparation to verify that one mostly has GUVs (few halos) rather than multilamellar (many rings). It also allows _real-time observation_ of dynamic processes (fusion, shape changes) in unstained vesicles.
    
- **Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) Microscopy:** DIC is another technique to enhance contrast in transparent samples by using polarized light interference. GUV membranes show up as thin pseudo-3D shaded images. DIC can visualize both unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles effectively ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=characterized%20as%20a%20%E2%80%9Cvesicles,The%20stained%20GVs%20are) ). Unlike phase-contrast, DIC doesn’t produce the same halo artifacts, so it can distinguish closely adjacent membranes. It’s particularly useful when imaging, say, a **vesicle within a vesicle** (GUV encapsulated inside another GUV): DIC can often let you see the inner vesicle, whereas phase-contrast might be confused by overlapping halos. The downside is that DIC has directional shadowing (one side of the vesicle may appear brighter), and it still doesn’t give molecular-specific information. But for morphology (shape, presence of tubules, etc.), DIC is a powerful tool. Both phase-contrast and DIC are commonly employed when introducing **no fluorescence** is desired (to avoid any dye perturbation of membrane properties).
    
- **Dark-Field Microscopy:** In dark-field, the illumination is arranged so that only light scattered by the sample enters the objective. A thin lipid membrane can scatter light if the conditions are right. Dark-field microscopy of GUVs essentially makes the membrane visible against a dark background by scattering. It has been reported that even a single bilayer can be detected, appearing as a bright outline, because the ~5 nm thick lipid shell scatters some light at the edges ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=dark,field) ) ([Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=resulting%20in%20fewer%20halos%20in,the%20interference%20of%20ambient%20transmitted) ). Dark-field is very sensitive to any particles or defects on the membrane (which scatter strongly). It “completely shuts out” the transmitted beam around the vesicle, improving edge visibility ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=characterized%20as%20a%20%E2%80%9Cvesicles,The%20stained%20GVs%20are) ). This technique requires clean optics and is less common than phase/DIC for GUVs, but has been used, for example, to visualize nanoscale defects on membranes or attached nanoparticles that wouldn’t be seen in phase images. Dark-field can resolve very thin filaments or tubes extruded from GUVs because of the strong scattering from such edges.
    
- **Fluorescence Microscopy:** The workhorse of GUV imaging is fluorescence. By incorporating a small fraction of fluorescent lipid (or membrane-binding dye), one can directly observe the membrane with high specificity. Epifluorescence microscopy reveals the **membrane geometry** clearly – one sees a glowing circle (if in focus equator) or sphere for each vesicle. Fluorescence allows multiplexing: different dyes can stain different membrane components or encapsulated contents (e.g., one color for the membrane, another for a protein or domain). A major advantage is the ability to detect **phase separation**: using two dyes that partition differently into liquid-ordered vs disordered phases, one can literally see coexisting domains as regions of different color or brightness. For example, a green lipid dye might concentrate in cholesterol-rich domains, making them appear as green patches on a red background membrane. Fluorescence is also crucial for tracking **proteins or DNA**attached to GUVs – fluorescently tagged molecules show their distribution (uniform or patchy) on the membrane. The limitation of epifluorescence is that it integrates all light along the z-axis through the vesicle, so it can be hard to tell if something is on the front or back side of the GUV. It also suffers from out-of-focus blur if there are many vesicles at different depths. Nevertheless, conventional fluorescence microscopy has been extremely powerful for qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of GUV systems. It completely avoids the problem of the membrane being invisible in bright-field, at the cost of needing to introduce fluorophores (which can sometimes affect membrane properties if used at too high concentration). Photobleaching and phototoxicity (light-induced damage) are concerns for long observations – intense illumination can oxidize lipids, potentially causing artifact membrane changes over time. Careful control experiments (such as comparing to phase-contrast images, or using antioxidant cocktails) are often done to ensure that observed phenomena are not due to the fluorescence illumination itself.
    
- **Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy:** Confocal microscopy has become a standard for GUV imaging because it provides optical sectioning – i.e. the ability to take crisp cross-sectional slices through a vesicle. With confocal, one can focus inside the equator of a GUV and image a thin slice, avoiding blurring from the rest of the vesicle. This is especially useful for **3D structure**: one can scan through the vesicle and reconstruct its 3D shape, or detect internal structures like vesicles encapsulated inside or protein aggregates within. Confocal also improves resolution slightly in the lateral plane and significantly in the axial direction compared to wide-field fluorescence. Many automated algorithms for analyzing GUV images rely on confocal data because the vesicle contour can be extracted from a single optical slice without interference from out-of-focus parts ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=soluble%20dyes%20and%20colored%20particles,scanning%20fluorescence%20microscopy%20images%20was) ). For example, one group developed an automated pipeline to assess GUV size, membrane intensity, and morphological features from confocal z-stacks ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=light%20is%20completely%20shut%20out%2C,They%20found%20that%20the%20deduced) ). Confocal’s drawbacks are slower imaging speed (scanning point by point) and higher light dosage (which could accelerate bleaching). Still, it has enabled advanced experiments like visualizing the formation of membrane nanotubes and buds in 3D, and co-localizing multiple fluorescent markers with less crosstalk.
    
- **Super-Resolution Optical Microscopy:** In the last few years, super-resolution techniques have been applied to GUVs to overcome the ~200 nm diffraction limit of conventional optics. **STED (Stimulated Emission Depletion) microscopy** has been a notable example: researchers, particularly the group of R. Dimova, used STED to resolve structures like membrane nanotubes and small buds on GUVs that were previously blurred ([Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=light%20is%20completely%20shut%20out%2C,They%20found%20that%20the%20deduced) ). STED can improve lateral resolution to ~50 nm or better. Using STED, Dimova’s team was able to **directly measure the diameter of membrane nanotubes** pulled from GUVs, which in turn allowed calculation of tube tension and bending rigidity ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=,PMC%20free%20article) ). This represented a super-res optical approach to what was traditionally done by force measurements, and it confirmed that membrane tension measured by this optical method agreed with micropipette aspiration values ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=,PMC%20free%20article) ). Other super-res methods like PALM or STORM could be applied if photophysical conditions are met, but these have been less reported, likely because GUVs are large and sparsely labeled compared to cellular imaging. STED, being a targeted depletion approach, can scan along the membrane of a GUV to provide greater detail, e.g. resolving ~30 nm separation between two protein clusters on the membrane – something not possible with confocal. The main **limitations of super-resolution** on GUVs are photobleaching and the need for high-intensity lasers, which can cause heating or chemical damage to the membrane (lipid oxidation). Also, if the GUV is freely floating, stage drift or Brownian motion can blur super-res images; this is often solved by gently immobilizing GUVs (e.g. by sticking them to a poly-lysine coated surface) during imaging, at the risk of slightly perturbing their spherical shape.
    
- **Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Imaging:** While AFM is primarily a force probe, it can also be used to image surfaces with nanometer resolution. In the context of GUVs, AFM has been used to image **supported GUV membranes** – for instance, if a GUV is burst on a substrate to form a supported bilayer, AFM can map membrane domains or thickness. However, true 3D imaging of an intact GUV by AFM is challenging because the vesicle will deform under the tip. Some studies have succeeded in imaging the outer surface of an adhered GUV, revealing, for example, the height of lipid domains (if one phase is thicker, AFM can measure that height difference of ~1 nm). AFM imaging of **soft, large objects** like GUVs is limited by the need to stabilize the object. Typically, **substrate-adhered vesicles** (slightly flattened by gentle adsorption to a surface) are used ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=shell%20GUVs%29%20%28Fig,measurement%20time%20are%20worth%20noting)). This inevitably imposes some deformation and tension on the vesicle compared to its free state. Additionally, the scan times are long (minutes), so any dynamic changes are not captured. Despite that, AFM has uniquely shown fine details like the presence of nanoscopic texture due to phase separation that optical microscopy couldn’t see. AFM can also confirm the presence of any polymer residues on the membrane by their mechanical signature. But overall, AFM is “largely underutilized” for GUV studies so far, mostly due to setup complexity and the above limitations ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=complexes%20,and%20area%20compressibility%20modulus%20using)) ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=shell%20GUVs%29%20%28Fig,measurement%20time%20are%20worth%20noting)). It remains a specialized tool, whereas optical microscopy (particularly fluorescence and confocal) is the daily workhorse for GUV research.
    

**Summary of Imaging:** Optical microscopy offers a **non-invasive, real-time window** into GUV behavior. Phase-contrast and DIC allow observation of **unstained vesicles** and are excellent for tracking shape changes or identifying multilamellarity ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=characterized%20as%20a%20%E2%80%9Cvesicles,The%20stained%20GVs%20are) ). Fluorescence and confocal microscopy provide **specificity and 3D resolution**, essential for studying composition heterogeneity, protein localization, and internal contents ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=soluble%20dyes%20and%20colored%20particles,scanning%20fluorescence%20microscopy%20images%20was) ). Advanced methods like STED push the resolution to the nanoscale, uncovering details of membrane structure that connect to membrane mechanics ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=light%20is%20completely%20shut%20out%2C,They%20found%20that%20the%20deduced) ). AFM complements these by offering nanoscale topographical and mechanical maps at the cost of temporal resolution ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=complexes%20,and%20area%20compressibility%20modulus%20using)) ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=shell%20GUVs%29%20%28Fig,measurement%20time%20are%20worth%20noting)). One always must consider imaging artifacts: for example, fluorescent dyes can photo-damage lipids; also, observation under a microscope often requires immobilizing vesicles (either by gentle surface adhesion or by embedding in agarose gel) to keep them in focus, which can alter their natural state. Researchers mitigate these by careful controls, such as imaging the same phenomenon with multiple modes (phase and fluorescence) and by minimizing light exposure. The **current trend** is integrating microscopy with other techniques – e.g. confocal combined with micropipette aspiration setups, or fluorescence combined with micromanipulators – to get a fuller picture of GUV responses. A **remaining challenge** in imaging GUVs is achieving single-molecule resolution on membranes (to watch individual protein molecules in a GUV membrane, akin to what is done in live cells). Techniques like single-particle tracking have been applied: by embedding trace amounts of fluorescently labeled lipids or proteins and using high-speed cameras, researchers can track their diffusion on the GUV surface, extracting membrane viscosity and interaction information. As super-resolution advances and is more frequently applied, we expect even richer detail from GUV imaging, bridging the gap between **mesoscopic observations (micron-scale shape)** and **nanoscopic molecular organization** on these model membranes.

## 7. Manipulation Techniques for GUVs

Manipulating GUVs – moving them, deforming them, or perturbing them in controlled ways – is crucial for many experiments. Several methods have been refined to handle these delicate micrometer-sized sacs:

- **Micropipette Aspiration and Microinjection:** As discussed in section 2, a glass micropipette with a fine tip can be used to gently suction a GUV. Besides measuring mechanics, this technique allows one to **hold a vesicle in place** stably (acting like a handle or “tweezer”) and to **transport it** by moving the pipette. Pipettes can also inject or extract material from GUVs by penetrating the membrane with the tip ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=that%20by%20applying%20positive%20pressure,105%2C83%20%2C%20107) ). For example, a skilled operator can use a micromanipulator to insert a micropipette into a GUV and deposit latex beads or DNA inside, or suck out some inner solution. This is analogous to cell microinjection but easier, since GUVs lack an actin cortex and are more deformable. One limitation is that the GUV must be big enough (>5–10 µm) for the pipette (~1 µm tip) to go in without immediately lysing it; also, the membrane will self-heal after pipette withdrawal only if the puncture is small and slow. Micropipette manipulation was extended by Orwar’s group to create **networks of vesicles**: they electrically pulled out membrane nanotubes from a GUV with a pipette and then attached that tubule to a second vesicle, forming a membrane tether between two GUVs ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=Orwar%E2%80%99s%20group%20extended%20the%20micropipette,In%20contrast%2C%20Lobovkina%E2%80%99s%20group%20reported) ) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=inside%2C%20which%20is%20often%20used,In%20contrast%2C%20Lobovkina%E2%80%99s%20group%20reported) ). By adjusting the pipette’s position and applied pressure, they could shuttle contents between vesicles or fuse them. This showcases the versatility of micropipette tools for “remote controlling” vesicles. Drawbacks include the need for an open chamber and human operation (though semi-automated systems exist now with multiple pipettes working in parallel ([Active probing of the mechanical properties of biological and ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304416519302752#:~:text=confirming%20previous%20measurements%20on%20GUVs,135)) ([Parallel on-chip micropipettes enabling quantitative multiplexed ...](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apb/article/8/2/026122/3298044/Parallel-on-chip-micropipettes-enabling#:~:text=Parallel%20on,to%20the%20insertion%20of))).
    
- **Optical Tweezers (Laser Trapping):** Optical tweezers use a focused laser beam to trap small objects via radiation pressure forces. GUVs, being relatively large (and having refractive index close to water if filled with aqueous solution), are not as easily trapped as, say, solid beads. But there are two main approaches to use optical tweezers with GUVs: trapping **attached beads** or trapping **the vesicle directly** if it contains a higher index medium. In early experiments, it was observed that a strong laser focus could deform a GUV – the light’s radiation pressure pushed in the membrane to form an indentation ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=Laser%20technology%20has%20advanced%20research,21%5D.%20Inaba%20et) ). If the interior of the GUV has a higher refractive index (e.g., sugar solution) than the outside, the optical trap can actually hold the GUV by the refractive index difference, allowing one to **move entire vesicles** in 3D by moving the laser focus ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=manipulation,that%20were%20suspended%20and%20shifted) ). Another strategy is to use a small dielectric bead attached to the membrane (either stuck electrostatically or via a biotin-streptavidin linkage) and trap the bead ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=match%20at%20L555%20optical%20tweezer,Taking%20advantage%20of%20the) ) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=refractive%20index%20can%20be%20carried,optical%20tweezers%2C%20brought%20them%20into) ). By moving the trapped bead, one can pull on the membrane – often this leads to a thin membrane tether (nanotube) extruding from the GUV as the bead is withdrawn, providing a handle to exert controlled force on the membrane ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=refractive%20index%20can%20be%20carried,optical%20tweezers%2C%20brought%20them%20into) ). This technique has been used to study tether formation and to measure membrane curvature elasticity by seeing how the tether radius changes with tension. Optical tweezers have also enabled **vesicle-vesicle interactions**: one can trap one GUV and drive it into contact with another fixed GUV to induce fusion or content mixing ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=fact%20that%20optical%20tweezers%20exert,90%5D.%20Shiomi) ) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=using%20an%20optical%20tweezer%20inside,gradient%20of%20the%20force%20of) ). Elani _et al._leveraged this to perform a two-step enzymatic reaction – they guided two GUVs together (each containing different reagents) and used a brief electrical pulse to fuse them, mixing contents to start a reaction, then moved that vesicle to another to fuse with a third GUV containing a second reagent ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=fact%20that%20optical%20tweezers%20exert,90%5D.%20Shiomi) ) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=using%20an%20optical%20tweezer%20inside,gradient%20of%20the%20force%20of) ). This kind of precise assembly is uniquely enabled by optical tweezers. Additionally, novel configurations like line optical tweezers (using cylindrical beam profiles) have been used to stretch vesicles and even measure a shear modulus in chromatin-filled nuclei or gel-state vesicles ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1053%20M,Google%20Scholar) ). A recent advancement showed that even submicron vesicles can be manipulated by optical forces using specialized structures: **optical nanofibers** can create an evanescent light field that propels tiny vesicles along the fiber, effectively functioning as waveguide tweezers ([Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=match%20at%20L564%20using%20a,gradient%20of%20the%20force%20of) ) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=et%20al,115) ). This could be considered a bridge between optical and plasmonic trapping (discussed next). The main limitation of optical tweezers is potential laser-induced damage (especially heating) to GUVs if using high power, and the requirement that either the vesicle or a handle on it has sufficient refractive contrast. Nevertheless, optical tweezing has had _“great impact on GV manipulation”_ by enabling contactless, precise control ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=Laser%20technology%20has%20advanced%20research,sized) ).
    
- **Plasmonic Tweezers:** Plasmonic tweezers employ nanostructures (often metallic nanoantennas) to concentrate optical fields at the nanoscale, thereby trapping objects much smaller than can be trapped by conventional tweezers. While plasmonic tweezers are typically used for nanoparticles or proteins, they can interface with lipid vesicles in certain ways. For instance, plasmonic trapping can be used to arrange nanoparticles _on a GUV membrane_, effectively patterning the membrane with particles. Or one can envisage trapping very small lipid vesicles (sub-micron) and bringing them to a GUV for fusion. In the context of giant vesicles, plasmonic tweezers have been less directly utilized, but there are relevant developments. A 2022 study demonstrated arrays of plasmonic nano-cavities that could capture individual extracellular vesicles (~100 nm) rapidly ([Scalable trapping of single nanosized extracellular vesicles using ...](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40549-7#:~:text=Scalable%20trapping%20of%20single%20nanosized,plasmonic%20cavities%2C%20enabling%20instant)) ([Scalable trapping of single nanosized extracellular vesicles using ...](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40549-7#:~:text=,plasmonic%20cavities%2C%20enabling%20instant)). Extrapolating this, if one wanted to study how a 100 nm vesicle fuses with a GUV, one could use plasmonic traps to hold the small vesicle in place near a GUV. Another idea is using plasmonic heating to locally destabilize a GUV membrane at the trap site, facilitating fusion or pore formation exactly where a nanoparticle is held. While direct literature on “plasmonic tweezers for GUVs” is scant, these advanced optical tools are a growing area and potentially allow **parallel, multi-trap manipulation** (since one can have many nanostructures on a chip, each trapping a small object, much like an optical lattice). Thus, one could envision a chip that corrals numerous small cargo vesicles and delivers them to larger GUVs in a controlled fashion. The **advantage of plasmonic traps** is their strength at nanoscale and fast response, but a challenge is they typically operate very close to surfaces (where the nanostructures reside), which might not be ideal for free-floating GUVs except in specialized geometries.
    
- **Magnetic Tweezers and Fields:** If GUVs are made with encapsulated magnetic particles or ferrofluid, they can be manipulated by magnetic fields ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=Schematic%20illustration%20of%20manipulation%20of,for%20GVs%20encapsulating%20ferrofluid) ) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=Schematic%20illustration%20of%20manipulation%20of,for%20GVs%20encapsulating%20ferrofluid) ). One group encapsulated magnetic nanoparticles inside GUVs, effectively making “magneto-vesicles”. By applying a magnetic field gradient, they could move these vesicles remotely or hold them in place. Moreover, a rotating magnetic field can spin a magnetized vesicle, which can be used to apply shear stress to the membrane. Magnetic approaches are still relatively uncommon with GUVs, but they offer the benefit of **no photodamage** and the ability to penetrate opaque media. The difficulty is getting enough magnetic material inside without disrupting the vesicle.
    
- **Microfluidic Flow Manipulation:** Microfluidic devices have been devised to **steer and deform GUVs using flow**. In narrow microchannels, the laminar flow can transport vesicles to specific locations (like traps or sensors). Designs with funnel or constricted geometries apply controlled compression to GUVs as they are pushed through, mimicking the squeezing of cells in capillaries. One such flow-based system gently pushed GUVs through a bottleneck and observed how they deform and subsequently recover shape, providing insight into vesicle elasticity and the effect of tension. Another creative device uses **microfabricated cup-shaped traps**: as flow carries vesicles along, they get caught in these cups. Researchers have even used flowing streams to sort GUVs by size or composition (if one GUV is more deformable, it might get trapped differently than a stiff one). Dittrich’s group developed a microfluidic chip that can capture individual GUVs in arrayed traps by circulating flows and even create a little “curtain” of microbubbles to corral each vesicle in place ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=preparation%20method,trapping%20microstructure%20to) ). This facilitates high-throughput imaging or reactions on many GUVs simultaneously. **Flow-based manipulation** also includes mixing streams: for example, a GUV held in a chamber can have different solutions perfused around it rapidly, allowing application of stimuli (like adding a drug or changing pH) with quick exchange times. In essence, flow systems give a high degree of control over the vesicle’s environment and position. The limitations are the need to confine GUVs in small channels which can sometimes lead to unintended bursting if pressures are not well controlled, and the apparatus complexity. However, combining microfluidics with microscopy and perhaps optical tweezers yields powerful platforms – one can picture a future setup where GUVs are formed, manipulated, and analyzed all within one microfluidic chip.
    
- **Electric Field Manipulation:** GUVs respond to electric fields (beyond just electroformation). Pulsed electric fields can porate GUV membranes (electroporation), allowing controlled release or uptake of molecules. AC fields can induce dielectrophoretic forces on vesicles, moving them toward high-field regions. For example, by patterning electrodes, one can attract or repel vesicles at will. A notable application is using an electric field to **stretch vesicles**: a strong uniform AC field will elongate a vesicle along the field lines (electro-deformation), which can be used to measure mechanical properties or to orient vesicles in a certain direction ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=using%20micropipette%20aspiration%2C%20different%20membrane,differential%20role%20in%20regulating%20membrane)). Electric fields can also mediate fusion: bringing two GUVs into contact and then zapping them with a brief DC pulse often causes their membranes to fuse (a method borrowed from cell fusion protocols). This technique was used in conjunction with optical tweezers in some experiments to achieve selective fusion after assembly by lasers ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=fact%20that%20optical%20tweezers%20exert,92) ). Magnetoelectric and optoelectronic tweezing methods thus provide a toolkit for **non-contact manipulation**.
    

In summary, **manipulation methods enable researchers to treat GUVs not just as passive sacks, but as interactive objects** – one can grab them, push them, connect them, and subject them to forces or perturbations much like one does with living cells. Key achievements over the past decade include the ability to **coordinate multiple vesicles** (networks, controlled fusion) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=fact%20that%20optical%20tweezers%20exert,92) ), to apply calibrated forces and measure responses (using combined micropipette and optical tweezers setups) ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=match%20at%20L601%20micropipette%20aspiration,71%5D%2C%20respectively)), and to integrate GUV manipulation in microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip devices for parallel analysis ([Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=this%20is%20that%20conventional%20preparation,apparatus%20for) ) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=preparation%20method,trapping%20microstructure%20to) ). Current trends are toward automation and high-throughput – e.g., arrays of traps that can handle dozens of GUVs simultaneously for drug screening, or automated optical tweezers that can trap and move several vesicles in tandem (holographic tweezers can create multiple trap points from one laser). **Challenges** remain in delicately manipulating very small GUVs (<5 µm) which are less tolerant to mechanical contact (they tend to burst under pipette or surfaces) – this is where advanced traps like plasmonic or acoustic tweezers might play a future role. Another challenge is maintaining sterility and biochemical compatibility when using these physical tools (some microfluidic surfactants or oil traces can affect lipid membranes, for example). Nonetheless, the ability to manipulate model membranes with such precision is a major reason GUVs are considered a prime platform for **building and testing minimal cells**.

## 8. Theoretical Models and Simulations

Parallel to experimental advances, theoretical modeling and simulations have been crucial in interpreting GUV phenomena and predicting new behaviors. The large size and relatively simple composition of GUVs make them amenable to description by continuum physics models, while still being within reach of coarse-grained molecular simulations that can capture molecular detail. Key theoretical frameworks include:

**Curvature Elasticity (Helfrich Theory):** The seminal Helfrich model provides the foundation for understanding vesicle shapes and deformations. It posits that the membrane has a bending energy $E_b = \frac{1}{2}\kappa (C_1 + C_2 - C_0)^2 + \bar{\kappa} C_1 C_2$, integrating over the surface, where $C_1, C_2$ are principal curvatures and $C_0$ is the spontaneous curvature, $\kappa$ the bending rigidity and $\bar{\kappa}$ the Gaussian curvature modulus. For a symmetric lipid bilayer with no preferred curvature ($C_0=0$), the equilibrium shape of a vesicle is primarily dictated by volume-to-area ratio (or tension) and $\kappa$. In the 2010s, this theory was extended and applied to various scenarios observed in GUVs: budding transitions (where a vesicle forms a bud to minimize energy at certain area difference between leaflets), tubulation (where a vesicle extrudes a tube if that lowers bending energy under tension constraints), and critical curvature effects (like the minimum radius of a stable bud given $\kappa$). The Helfrich model successfully explains the **sequence of shape transitions** seen when deflating a GUV: sphere → oblate → stomatocyte (concave shape) as reduced volume decreases ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=5,Active%20particles%20induce%20large) ) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=,Martin%20C.%3B%20Feofilova%20M.%3B%20Eisentraut) ). It also underpins the analysis of **flicker spectroscopy** data: fitting the power spectrum of thermal shape fluctuations yields values for $\kappa$ and membrane tension that are consistent with micropipette experiments, confirming the model ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=match%20at%20L605%20Since%20the,role%20of%20increasing%20membrane%20tension)). The **bilayer-couple model** and **area-difference-elasticity model** are refinements that include the effect of differences in area between the two monolayers (which can induce spontaneous curvature and bud formation). These have been used to understand phenomena like multi-sphere shapes or budding induced by lipid asymmetry. For example, including an area difference term can predict the formation of an internal bud (stomatocyte) vs external bud (pear shape) depending on the sign of $C_0$, matching experiments where certain lipids added to the outer leaflet cause outward vs inward budding. Such theoretical predictions have been validated by systematically varying lipid compositions in GUVs and observing the resulting shapes ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=18.%20%20Agudo,Thermal%20fluctuations%20of) ) ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/lRmweAe4/#:~:text=vesicles%20is%20found%20consistent%20across,The)).

**Membrane Dynamics:** Beyond static shapes, theoretical work has addressed the dynamics of vesicle membranes – how they fluctuate and respond over time. The small deformation dynamics can be described by the coupling of the membrane hydrodynamics and the surrounding fluid. For example, the relaxation time of a curvature perturbation mode depends on membrane viscosity, bending modulus, and surrounding solvent viscosity (per the Evans-Sackmann theory). These predictions have been compared with GUV fluctuation relaxation measurements to infer membrane viscosity. Another aspect is vesicle dynamics in flow: **tank-treading** (membrane rotation around a vesicle in shear flow) and **tumbling** motions were first theoretically described by models treating the vesicle like a viscous droplet with a thin elastic shell. These models were confirmed in microfluidic experiments with GUVs in shear flow, showing transitions from tank-treading to flipping behavior depending on viscosity contrast and shear rate. Theory has also illuminated how **active processes** (like protein binding/unbinding or polymerization forces) can be incorporated: one can add active stress terms or curvature-generating terms to the Helfrich energy. This helps explain, for instance, oscillatory shape changes if proteins cyclically induce curvature (people have modeled min protein systems on GUVs that create pole-to-pole oscillations akin to those in _E. coli_).

**Particle and Polymer Interaction Models:** To rationalize particle wrapping (section 3), researchers developed analytical models and simulations that marry membrane elasticity with surface adhesion physics. One influential theoretical result by Deserno (2004) calculated the membrane deformation profile around a bound particle and predicted the force-distance relation for detaching a particle ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=,Aigal%20S) ). Later, Agudo-Canalejo & Lipowsky (2015) expanded theory to **bilayer asymmetry** – showing that if the two leaflets have differing compositions, the effective wrapping behavior changes, and they defined **critical particle sizes** for engulfment in symmetric vs asymmetric membranes ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=18.%20%20Agudo,Thermal%20fluctuations%20of) ). This helps interpret experiments where GUVs have asymmetric lipid distribution or where adding an area reservoir (like a floppy bud) can facilitate engulfment beyond the normal limit. For polymer adsorption, theoretical work has used polymer physics (self-avoiding chain models) combined with membrane elasticity to examine how a polymer adhering to a membrane can induce curvature. One interesting prediction was that a semiflexible polymer (like a filament) adsorbing on a vesicle can cause it to buckle or form inward tubulations if the polymer’s stiffness and adsorption energy hit certain regimes ([Shaping membrane vesicles by adsorption of a semiflexible polymer](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/sm/c7sm01751k#:~:text=Shaping%20membrane%20vesicles%20by%20adsorption,We%20further%20characterize)). There are indeed observations of DNA or actin filaments binding to GUVs and causing subtle shape changes, qualitatively in line with such models ( [Studying actin-induced cell shape changes using Giant Unilamellar Vesicles and reconstituted actin networks - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9704537/#:~:text=Helfer%20et%20al,presence%20of%20actin%20filaments%2C%20these) ) ( [Studying actin-induced cell shape changes using Giant Unilamellar Vesicles and reconstituted actin networks - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9704537/#:~:text=their%20membrane%20by%20biotin,to%20their%20fluidity%2C%20there%20is) ).

**Simulations:** On the computational side, methods range from atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) for small patches of bilayer (or very small vesicles) to coarse-grained simulations (Dissipative Particle Dynamics, MARTINI coarse-grained MD, etc.) that can simulate vesicles of tens of nanometers, up to continuum finite-element simulations for micron-scale shapes. In the last decade, **coarse-grained MD** has been particularly useful for connecting molecular details to continuum parameters. For instance, simulations by the Marrink and Deserno groups have systematically measured bending rigidity by simulating a vesicle or a bilayer patch and analyzing its fluctuations ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=20,Google%20Scholar) ). They have explored effects of cholesterol, lipid tail length, and protein insertion on κ – providing molecular explanations for experimental values. **Interleaflet friction** has also been studied: simulations can determine how quickly two monolayers slide, which relates to membrane shear viscosity measured in GUVs. Notably, simulations have addressed the question of **residual solvents or polymers in membranes**: a coarse-grained simulation of a phase-transfer vesicle found that a tiny oil layer remained in the bilayer core, thickening it by a few Å and slightly decoupling the two leaflets ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/lRmweAe4/#:~:text=vesicles%20is%20found%20consistent%20across,The)) ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/lRmweAe4/#:~:text=the%20inner%20leaflet%20poses%20challenges,membranes%20with%20higher%20compressibility%20modulus)). This correlates with experimental findings that bending modulus didn’t change much (since thickness increase can be compensated by oil softness) but dynamics did (leaflet coupling reduced) in vesicles formed by emulsion methods.

**Membrane–Particle Simulations:** Simulations have been vital in understanding multi-particle interactions on GUVs. Monte Carlo and Brownian dynamics simulations have reproduced how two particles on a membrane feel an effective attraction due to membrane-mediated forces ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=,Google%20Scholar) ). They show that if one particle induces a dimple, a second particle is drawn into that dimple to save energy (much like two balls on a rubber sheet roll together). This underlies the clustering of bound particles seen in experiments ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=from%20surfing%20to%20partial%20to,can%20influence%20the%20engulfment%20pathway)). More advanced simulations by Šarić et al. have even simulated hundreds of nanoparticles interacting with a vesicle, observing outcomes like engulfment of many at once, vesicle collapse, or budding full of nanoparticles, depending on adhesion strength – providing phase diagrams that complement experimental observations ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=studies,29%2C16%20%2C%2031) ) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=,Google%20Scholar) ).

**Active and Non-equilibrium Models:** A frontier in theory is describing GUVs driven out of equilibrium – for instance, by active proteins (like an actin polymerization causing a propagating wave on the membrane). Theoretical models such as reaction-diffusion equations on the vesicle surface have been used to simulate protein oscillations (like Min waves on a spherical membrane) and predict patterns that were later confirmed on GUVs. These models must incorporate curvature coupling (proteins that prefer certain curvature will accumulate in high curvature regions, thus influencing the pattern).

In essence, theoretical work provides a **quantitative language** for GUV phenomena, often condensing complex behavior into a few dimensionless parameters (like the Föppl-von Kármán number for membrane stretching vs bending, or the Damköhler number for reaction rate vs diffusion in surface pattern formation). A **trend** in recent years is tighter integration between experiment and theory – many experimental GUV papers include companion simulations or analytical modeling. For example, in studies of asymmetric membranes, groups performed both micropipette experiments on GUVs and MD simulations of asymmetric bilayers to see if the effective moduli match and to understand the molecular basis of the asymmetry effects ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/lRmweAe4/#:~:text=vesicles%20is%20found%20consistent%20across,The)) ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/lRmweAe4/#:~:text=the%20inner%20leaflet%20poses%20challenges,membranes%20with%20higher%20compressibility%20modulus)). Another trend is applying machine learning to analyze GUV shape fluctuations and infer parameters, effectively letting theory-driven algorithms measure properties from video data automatically.

**Remaining Theoretical Challenges:** While classical models explain a great deal, there are challenges such as describing **vesicle rupture and pore dynamics** (a rapid, discontinuous event that requires models of membrane lysis), understanding **extreme deformations** (when a vesicle is stretched into highly non-spherical shapes beyond small perturbation theory), and capturing **molecular specificity** in continuum models (e.g., how to include the effect of lipid composition on spontaneous curvature or how a protein’s geometry dictates the $C_0$ it imposes). Multi-scale modeling that links atomistic details (like exact lipid packing or the presence of lipid microstructure) to continuum properties (κ, σ, etc.) is an ongoing effort.

The theoretical and simulation advances thus far have been key to interpreting experiments: for example, the concept of **critical engulfment size** ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=18.%20%20Agudo,Thermal%20fluctuations%20of) ), the understanding that **oil residues mainly affect thickness, not stiffness** ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/lRmweAe4/#:~:text=vesicles%20is%20found%20consistent%20across,The)), or that an **actin shell adds an effective shear modulus** to a membrane ( [Studying actin-induced cell shape changes using Giant Unilamellar Vesicles and reconstituted actin networks - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9704537/#:~:text=transverse%20thermal%20fluctuations%20by%20increasing,strengthens%20the%20GUV%20membrane%20by) ) all arise from synergistic theory-experiment work. Going forward, theory will continue to guide the design of new GUV experiments (e.g., predicting what pattern a protein might form on a vesicle or what composition will yield a target bending modulus), while experiments will feed back to refine the models (e.g., incorporating membrane fluctuations in active matter theory). The relatively “clean” system of a GUV – compared to the messy, multiphase environment of a living cell – means that theoretical assumptions (like a uniform elastic surface) are often well satisfied, making GUVs a favorite playground for membrane physicists ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=5,Active%20particles%20induce%20large) ) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=,Martin%20C.%3B%20Feofilova%20M.%3B%20Eisentraut) ).

## Outlook: Trends and Challenges

Over the last ten years, research on GUVs has significantly advanced our understanding of membrane biophysics and enabled the construction of increasingly life-like artificial cells. **Key findings** can be summarized as follows: (1) New preparation methods (gel-assisted, microfluidic, etc.) have expanded the range of conditions under which we can create stable GUVs, allowing investigations of membranes in more realistic (physiological) environments ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=control%20method,However%2C%20since%20the) ) ( [Bending rigidity, capacitance and shear viscosity of giant vesicle membranes prepared by spontaneous swelling, electroformation, gel-assisted and phase transfer methods: a comparative study - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671160/#:~:text=,method%20for%20GUVs%20in%20respect) ). (2) Quantitative characterization of membrane mechanics in GUVs has solidified models of membrane elasticity – for instance, confirming typical bending rigidities in the tens of k_BT and demonstrating how additives like cholesterol, proteins, or polymers tune these values ([Methods to mechanically perturb and characterize GUV-based minimal cell models - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal](https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370\(22\)00583-9/abstract#:~:text=example%2C%20mechanical%20tests%20using%20micropipette,permease%20into%20the%20GUV%20bilayer)) ( [Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=composition%2C%20they%20can%20also%20be,like%20membranes.%20By%20contrast) ). (3) Studies of GUV interactions with particles and polymers have illuminated general principles of membrane adhesion and wrapping, directly informing fields like drug delivery (e.g., what size/shape of nanoparticle is optimal for cellular uptake) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=studies,29%2C16%20%2C%2031) ) ( [Role of Shape in Particle-Lipid Membrane Interactions: From Surfing to Full Engulfment - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11025115/#:~:text=study%20aims%20to%20elucidate%20the,results%20are%20consistent%20with%20theoretical) ) and virus entry. (4) By serving as minimal cells, GUVs have enabled groundbreaking synthetic biology experiments, from gene expression in a cell-like compartment to realizations of primitive cell division, highlighting what is physically required for these processes to occur ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=proteins%2C%20DNA%2C%20and%20RNA%2C%20have,33%2C15%20%2C%2035%2C17%20%2C%2037) ) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=fact%20that%20optical%20tweezers%20exert,92) ). (5) Advanced microscopy and manipulation techniques applied to GUVs have provided unprecedented visualization and control of membrane processes, such as seeing membrane nanotubes via STED ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=light%20is%20completely%20shut%20out%2C,They%20found%20that%20the%20deduced) ) or pulling membrane tethers with optical tweezers to measure nanonewton forces ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=refractive%20index%20can%20be%20carried,optical%20tweezers%2C%20brought%20them%20into) ).

Current research **trends** are moving toward _greater complexity and realism_ in GUV models. One trend is **multi-component GUVs** – not just a simple lipid mixture, but inclusion of membrane proteins, glycofunctionalization (a “GUV glycocalyx”), and cytoskeletal cortex assembly. This aims to create vesicles that are as close to cells as possible in composition, to test biological hypotheses in a controlled way ( [Polysaccharide functionalization reduces lipid vesicle stiffness - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11145274/#:~:text=Polysaccharides%20are%20a%20fundamental%20component,It%20may%20also%20be%20of) ) ( [Studying actin-induced cell shape changes using Giant Unilamellar Vesicles and reconstituted actin networks - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9704537/#:~:text=Helfer%20et%20al,a%202D%20shear%20modulus%20on) ). Another trend is **high-throughput and quantitative assays** using GUVs: instead of anecdotal observation of a few vesicles, researchers are using microfluidics and automated image analysis to gather statistics on hundreds of vesicles, for example to accurately measure the distribution of rupture tensions or the efficiency of content mixing in fusion events ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=preparation%20method,trapping%20microstructure%20to) ) ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications | CoLab](https://colab.ws/articles/10.1016%2Fj.cis.2023.102935#:~:text=electric%2C%20and%20magnetic%20barriers,potential%20techniques%20for%20dedicated%20applications)). This is important for making GUV experiments more reproducible and applicable to materials science (like screening many formulations for drug delivery vesicles). A notable trend in application is the use of GUVs in **biosensing and drug screening** – GUVs can act as biosensors that report on membrane integrity or protein binding, and arrays of GUVs have been used to test how different compounds affect membrane permeability ([[PDF] Spectroscopic and Microscopic Approaches for ... - Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medical-technology/articles/10.3389/fmedt.2020.628552/pdf#:~:text=This%20assay%20relies%20on%20the,model%20antimicrobial%20peptide%20in)) ([Measuring thousands of single vesicle leakage events reveals the ...](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.13.455434v1.full-text#:~:text=,peptides%20with%20a%20high)). On the theoretical side, a trend is coupling **active matter physics** with GUVs, such as modeling how active protein processes or metabolic activity inside a vesicle influences its mechanics and shape.

Despite the progress, several **challenges** remain in the field of GUV research. One challenge is achieving and maintaining **membrane asymmetry** (different inner vs outer leaflet composition) in GUVs. Real cell membranes are asymmetric, which affects their mechanical and chemical properties, but making a GUV with a specified asymmetry is difficult. Methods like lipid exchange or inner leaflet loading have been developed, but ensuring stability and measuring the exact asymmetry is non-trivial ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/lRmweAe4/#:~:text=vesicles%20is%20found%20consistent%20across,The)) ([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/lRmweAe4/#:~:text=the%20inner%20leaflet%20poses%20challenges,membranes%20with%20higher%20compressibility%20modulus)). Asymmetric GUVs sometimes relax toward symmetry by lipid flip-flop, so finding ways to stabilize asymmetry (perhaps using lipid variants with very slow flip-flop) is an ongoing effort. Another challenge is **integrating multiple functionalities** into a single GUV. For example, in synthetic cell projects, one might want a GUV that can express proteins, maintain a cytoskeletal network, and communicate (fusion or signaling) with other GUVs. Each of those subsystems (genetic circuit, cytoskeleton, fusogenic membrane) individually has been demonstrated, but putting them all together without interference is hard – the conditions to optimize one may disrupt another (e.g., magnesium for transcription affects actin polymerization, etc.). Achieving a fully functional artificial cell will require careful balancing of these elements.

On the biophysical side, a challenge is to push measurements to the **molecular level**: can we observe single protein molecules diffusing and functioning in a GUV membrane at real-time? Techniques are approaching that limit but not quite there for freely moving GUVs. Also, while mechanical properties of simple lipid membranes are well characterized, membranes containing complex mixtures (lipidomes closer to cell membranes, with dozens of lipid species) are largely unexplored in GUV form due to preparation difficulty. Developing methods to form GUVs from native cell membrane extracts could allow direct study of realistic membrane composition in a controlled GUV setting – a challenging but valuable goal.

From a technological perspective, **stability** and **scalability** of GUV production is a practical challenge for industrial or clinical applications. Liposomes are already used in medicine (e.g., mRNA vaccine delivery), but those are mostly nanometer-scale LUVs. GUVs could potentially serve as microreactors or drug carriers for large payloads, but producing and storing them in large quantity is tough – they are more fragile and prone to aggregation or oxidation over time. Research into polymer-lipid hybrids and encapsulating antioxidants is partially addressing this, making vesicles tougher ( [Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=different%20properties%20such%20as%20bending,and%20surprisingly%2C%20some%20properties%20are) ) ( [Polymer–Lipid Hybrid Materials - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11905483/#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20hybrid%20vesicles%20can%3A%20,delivery%2C%2032%E2%80%9324%20field%20effect%20transistors) ).

In conclusion, giant unilamellar vesicles have established themselves as a **versatile platform bridging biology, chemistry, and physics**. They have yielded fundamental insights (like how membrane tension can be measured optically ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=,PMC%20free%20article) ) or how an actin cortex stiffens a membrane ( [Studying actin-induced cell shape changes using Giant Unilamellar Vesicles and reconstituted actin networks - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9704537/#:~:text=Helfer%20et%20al,a%202D%20shear%20modulus%20on) )) and are paving the way for constructing life-like systems from the bottom up. The next decade will likely see GUVs used even more in interdisciplinary ways – perhaps as smart drug delivery devices that can sense the environment and release contents on cue, or as simplified cell models to test synthetic pathways (e.g., artificial organelles within GUVs performing photosynthesis or replication). By continuing to refine experimental methods and theoretical models, and by addressing the challenges of complexity and stability, researchers will further unlock the potential of GUVs to both explain the **principles of cellular membranes** and harness them in **innovative applications**([Advances in giant unilamellar vesicle preparation techniques and applications | CoLab](https://colab.ws/articles/10.1016%2Fj.cis.2023.102935#:~:text=electric%2C%20and%20magnetic%20barriers,potential%20techniques%20for%20dedicated%20applications)) ( [Identifying and Manipulating Giant Vesicles: Review of Recent Approaches - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9144095/#:~:text=supramolecular%20chemistry%20for%20understanding%20cellular,33%2C15%20%2C%2035%2C17%20%2C%2037) ).
