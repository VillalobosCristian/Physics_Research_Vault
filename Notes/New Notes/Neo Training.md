# Ionizing Radiation Summary

## 1. Penetrating Power of Ionizing Radiation
- **Alpha Particles (α):**
  - Travel a few centimeters in air.
  - Stopped by **paper**.
- **Beta Particles (β):**
  - Travel several centimeters to meters in air, depending on energy.
  - Stopped by **plexiglass**.
- **X-rays and Gamma Rays (γ):**
  - Extremely penetrating.
  - Attenuated by heavy materials like **lead** or **concrete**.
- **Neutrons:**
  - High penetration power.
  - Slowed by materials containing light nuclei (e.g., **water**, **paraffin**).

## 2. Penetration Through Human Skin
- **Alpha Particles:**
  - Stop at the **epidermis** (outer skin layer).
- **Beta Particles:**
  - Penetrate to the **dermis**.
- **Gamma Rays & X-rays:**
  - Can pass entirely through the body.
- **Note:** Used in medical imaging (e.g., X-rays) for diagnostic purposes.

## 3. Benefits and Costs of Ionizing Radiation
### Costs:
- Odorless, invisible, and imperceptible.
- Effects can appear **years after exposure**.

### Benefits:
- Measurable with the right equipment.
- Useful in fields like **medical imaging** and **scientific research**.

## 4. Types of Ionizing Radiation Sources
1. **Unsealed Sources:**
   - Radioactive substances in **liquid, solid, or gas form**.
   - **Risk**: Potential release and contamination.
   - **Example**: Used as tracers in biology.
2. **Sealed Sources:**
   - Contained in **secure containers**.
   - No risk of release under normal conditions.
   - **Example**: Source irradiators or scintillation counters.
3. **X-ray Generators:**
   - Produce ionizing radiation **without radioactive material**.
   - Common in research and medical diagnostics.

## Part 2: 

An individual can be contaminated by radioactive sources via ingestion, inhalation or skin contact. They can be irradiated by a distant source.
