 (a) Schematic representation of the experimenta(b) Temperature-induced membrane deformation mechanisms including thermal expansion, tension modulation, and phase transitions. (c) Coupling between thermal actuation, membrane mechanics, and surface adhesion enabling the transition from static adhesion to crawling motility. Scale bar: 10 μm.
**Figure 2. Design and characterization of adhesion-tunable GUV library.** (a) Lipid compositions used for GUV fabrication: DOPC (fluid phase), DPPC (gel phase, Tm~40°C), and cholesterol-containing mixtures, with functional lipids for adhesion control. (b) Three adhesion regimes achieved through surface functionalization: (i) no adhesion via electrostatic repulsion, (ii) weak-mild adhesion via DNA hybridization, and (iii) strong adhesion via biotin-streptavidin binding. (c) Expected morphological transitions as a function of adhesion strength, from spherical (no adhesion) to spread configurations (strong adhesion). (d) Characterization methods including confocal microscopy for contact area measurement and AFM for adhesion force quantification.**Figure 3. Thermally-programmed crawling motility through adhesion-deformation coupling.** (a) Temperature gradient generation using metal films with thickness variations under uniform illumination, creating directional thermo-hydrodynamic flows. (b) Crawling mechanism: asymmetric deformation creates new binding sites at the leading edge while thermal-induced tension promotes detachment at the trailing edge. (c) Expected motility regimes as a function of temperature gradient and adhesion strength: continuous drift, step-wise crawling, stationary deformation, or membrane rupture. (d) Collective behavior showing anticipated spatial segregation of DOPC and DPPC vesicles based on composition-dependent thermal response. Arrows indicate flow direction and vesicle trajectories. Scale bar: 20 μm.
