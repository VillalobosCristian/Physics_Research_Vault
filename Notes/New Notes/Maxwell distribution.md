# Maxwell Distribution

Tha Maxwellian distribution describe the velocities of molecules in a fluid a [[temperature]] T in [[thermal equilibrium]]. 
The normalized [[equilibrium]] [[probability density function]] of one component of the velocity $v$, is a Gaussian given by:
$$\begin{align}
p^{\text{eq}}=\left(\frac{m}{2\pi k_{B}T}\right)^{1/2}e^{-\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}}.
\end{align}$$
The pre-factor is a normalization constant which ensure that the sum of probabilities over all velocity interval is equal to one. The following figure is a plot of $p^{\text{eq}}$ in function of $v$

The statistical properties of the distribution are given by.

**Mean value**
$$\langle v^{\text{eq}}\rangle=\int dv\ p^{\text{eq}}v=0$$
**Variance**
$$ \langle v^{\text{eq}}\rangle=\int dv \ v^{2}p^{\text{eq}}=\frac{k_{B}T}{m}$$
