The radial distribution function$g(r)$ tells u: How likely am I to find a particle at distance r from another particle, compared to a completely random distribution?

- **g(r) = 1**: Random distribution (like a gas)
- **g(r) > 1**: Particles prefer to be at distance r (structure/ordering)
- **g(r) < 1**: Particles avoid distance r (excluded volume, repulsion)
- **g(r) with peaks**: Crystalline order! Peaks show preferred neighbor distances
