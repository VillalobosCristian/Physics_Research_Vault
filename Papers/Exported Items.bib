  abstract = {Abstract             Phagocytic particle uptake is crucial for the fate of both living cells and pathogens. Invading particles have to overcome fluctuating lipid membranes as the first physical barrier. However, the energy and the role of the fluctuation-based particle-membrane interactions during particle uptake are not understood. We tackle this problem by indenting the membrane of differently composed Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) with optically trapped particles until particle uptake. By continuous 1\,MHz tracking and autocorrelating the particle’s positions within 30µs delays for different indentations, the fluctuations’ amplitude, the damping, the mean forces, and the energy profiles were obtained. Remarkably, the uptake energy into a GUV becomes predictable since it increases for smaller fluctuation amplitudes and longer relaxation time. Our observations could be explained by a mathematical model based on continuous suppression of fluctuation modes. Hence, the reduced particle uptake energy for protein-ligand interactions LecA-Gb3 or Biotin-Streptavidin results also from pronounced, low-friction membrane fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Although the interaction between microswimmers and walls during near-wall swimming has been extensively studied, the effect of microswimmer shapes and slip boundary conditions on the dynamic characteristics of near-wall microswimmers has received less attention. In this study, elliptical microswimmer models have been developed with various aspect ratios based on circular microswimmers. The lattice Boltzmann method has been used for the numerical simulation of the dynamic behaviour of microswimmers near walls. Under slip boundary conditions, the escape or capture of microswimmers by the walls is influenced by the swimming Reynolds number (                                Re                 s                              ), wall slip length (                                l                 s                              ) and the aspect ratio (                                C                 ab                              ) of a microswimmer. Changes in the                                C                 ab                              value of a microswimmer considerably affect its swimming state, especially for puller-type microswimmers. The tendency of pullers to be captured by the wall increases with increasing                                C                 ab                              . Moreover, changes in                                l                 s                              within the slip boundary condition of a puller can induce a transition in its movement state from a wall oscillation state to a stable sliding state and eventually to a wall lock-up state, a process influenced by the                                C                 ab                              value of the puller. Pusher-type microswimmers show a considerably increased tendency to escape from walls with increasing                                C                 ab                              and no wall lock-up state is observed, which is opposite to the case of pullers. Pushers and pullers show an increased tendency to be captured by the wall with increasing initial swimming angle of the microswimmer. The findings of this study enhance our understanding of the swimming patterns of natural microswimmers near walls and are of substantial importance for the design of artificial microswimmers and microfluidic devices.},

  abstract = {Understanding interactions between microparticles and lipid membranes is of increasing importance, especially for unraveling the influence of microplastics on our health and environment. Here, we study how a short-ranged adhesive force between microparticles and model lipid membranes causes membrane-mediated particle assembly. Using confocal microscopy, we observe the initial particle attachment to the membrane, then particle wrapping, and in rare cases spontaneous membrane tubulation. In the attached state, we measure that the particle mobility decreases by 26\%. If multiple particles adhere to the same vesicle, their initial single-particle state determines their interactions and subsequent assembly pathways: 1) attached particles only aggregate when small adhesive vesicles are present in solution, 2) wrapped particles reversibly attract one another by membrane deformation, and 3) a combination of wrapped and attached particles form membrane-mediated dimers, which further assemble into a variety of complex structures. The experimental observation of distinct assembly pathways, induced only by a short-ranged membrane-particle adhesion, shows that a cytoskeleton or other active components are not required for microparticle aggregation. We suggest that this membrane-mediated microparticle aggregation is a reason behind reported long retention times of polymer microparticles in organisms.},

  abstract = {The interplay of membrane proteins is vital for many biological processes, such as cellular transport, cell division, and signal transduction between nerve cells. Theoretical considerations have led to the idea that the membrane itself mediates protein selforganization in these processes through minimization of membrane curvature energy. Here, we present a combined experimental and numerical study in which we quantify these interactions directly for the first time. In our experimental model system we control the deformation of a lipid membrane by adhering colloidal particles. Using confocal microscopy, we establish that these membrane deformations cause an attractive interaction force leading to reversible binding. The attraction extends over 2.5 times the particle diameter and has a strength of three times the thermal energy (−3.3 kBT). Coarse-grained Monte-Carlo simulations of the system are in excellent agreement with the experimental results and prove that the measured interaction is independent of length scale. Our combined experimental and numerical results reveal membrane curvature as a common physical origin for interactions between any membrane-deforming objects, from nanometre-sized proteins to micrometresized particles.},
