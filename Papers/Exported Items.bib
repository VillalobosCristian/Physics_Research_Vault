  abstract = {Abstract             Phagocytic particle uptake is crucial for the fate of both living cells and pathogens. Invading particles have to overcome fluctuating lipid membranes as the first physical barrier. However, the energy and the role of the fluctuation-based particle-membrane interactions during particle uptake are not understood. We tackle this problem by indenting the membrane of differently composed Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) with optically trapped particles until particle uptake. By continuous 1\,MHz tracking and autocorrelating the particle’s positions within 30µs delays for different indentations, the fluctuations’ amplitude, the damping, the mean forces, and the energy profiles were obtained. Remarkably, the uptake energy into a GUV becomes predictable since it increases for smaller fluctuation amplitudes and longer relaxation time. Our observations could be explained by a mathematical model based on continuous suppression of fluctuation modes. Hence, the reduced particle uptake energy for protein-ligand interactions LecA-Gb3 or Biotin-Streptavidin results also from pronounced, low-friction membrane fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Since its inception more than thirty years ago, electroformation has become the most commonly used method for growing giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Although the method seems quite straightforward at first, researchers must consider the interplay of a large number of parameters, different lipid compositions, and internal solutions in order to avoid artifactual results or reproducibility problems. These issues motivated us to write a short review of the most recent methodological developments and possible pitfalls. Additionally, since traditional manual analysis can lead to biased results, we have included a discussion on methods for automatic analysis of GUVs. Finally, we discuss possible improvements in the preparation of GUVs containing high cholesterol contents in order to avoid the formation of artifactual cholesterol crystals. We intend this review to be a reference for those trying to decide what parameters to use as well as an overview providing insight into problems not yet addressed or solved.},

Here, Janus colloids fuelled only by glucose and light were designed, which can autonomously interact with cell-like compartments and trigger endocytosis. The crucial role played by the far field hydrodynamic interaction arising from the puller/pusher swimming mode and adhesion is evidenced. It is shown that a large contact time between the active particle and the lipid membrane is required to observe the engulfment of a particle inside a floppy giant lipid vesicle. Active Janus colloids showing relatively small velocities and a puller type swimming mode are able to target giant vesicles, deform their membranes and subsequently get stably engulfed. An instability arising from the unbound membrane segment is responsible for the transition between partial and complete stable engulfment. These experiments shed light on the physical criteria required for autonomous active particle engulfment in giant vesicles, which can serve as general principles in disciplines ranging from drug delivery and microbial infection to nanomedecine.},

  abstract = {Although the interaction between microswimmers and walls during near-wall swimming has been extensively studied, the effect of microswimmer shapes and slip boundary conditions on the dynamic characteristics of near-wall microswimmers has received less attention. In this study, elliptical microswimmer models have been developed with various aspect ratios based on circular microswimmers. The lattice Boltzmann method has been used for the numerical simulation of the dynamic behaviour of microswimmers near walls. Under slip boundary conditions, the escape or capture of microswimmers by the walls is influenced by the swimming Reynolds number (                                Re                 s                              ), wall slip length (                                l                 s                              ) and the aspect ratio (                                C                 ab                              ) of a microswimmer. Changes in the                                C                 ab                              value of a microswimmer considerably affect its swimming state, especially for puller-type microswimmers. The tendency of pullers to be captured by the wall increases with increasing                                C                 ab                              . Moreover, changes in                                l                 s                              within the slip boundary condition of a puller can induce a transition in its movement state from a wall oscillation state to a stable sliding state and eventually to a wall lock-up state, a process influenced by the                                C                 ab                              value of the puller. Pusher-type microswimmers show a considerably increased tendency to escape from walls with increasing                                C                 ab                              and no wall lock-up state is observed, which is opposite to the case of pullers. Pushers and pullers show an increased tendency to be captured by the wall with increasing initial swimming angle of the microswimmer. The findings of this study enhance our understanding of the swimming patterns of natural microswimmers near walls and are of substantial importance for the design of artificial microswimmers and microfluidic devices.},

This review highlights the role of neutron scattering, among other approaches, in uncovering the dynamic properties of lipid membranes.           ,              Cell membranes – primarily composed of lipids, sterols, and proteins – form a dynamic interface between living cells and their environment. They act as a mechanical barrier around the cell while selectively facilitating material transport, signal transduction, and various other functions necessary for the cell viability. The complex functionality of cell membranes and the hierarchical motions and responses they exhibit demand a thorough understanding of the origin of different membrane dynamics and how they are influenced by molecular additives and environmental cues. These dynamic modes include single-molecule diffusion, thermal fluctuations, and large-scale membrane deformations, to name a few. This review highlights advances in investigating structure-driven dynamics associated with model cell membranes, with a particular focus on insights gained from neutron scattering and spectroscopy experiments. We discuss the uniqueness of neutron contrast variation and its remarkable potential in probing selective membrane structure and dynamics on spatial and temporal scales over which key biological functions occur. We also present a summary of current and future opportunities in synergistic combinations of neutron scattering with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to gain further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex membrane functions.},

Three types of strain, i. e. stretching, tilt and curvature, are distinguished and the associated stresses are identified. It is argued that in the case of vesicles (= closed bilayer films) the only elasticity controlling nonspherical shapes is that of curvature. Euler-Lagrange equations are derived for the shape in magnetic fields and under excess outside pressure. It is shown that magnetic fields can deform spherical vesicles into ellipsoids of revolution. Under excess outside pressure the spherical shape becomes unstable at a certain threshold pressure. Both effects can be influenced by a spontaneous curvature of the bilayer. Some possible experiments to determine the elastic properties are also discussed},

  abstract = {Living systems are generally thought to have emerged from inorganic and organic compounds through the formation of compartments (molecular assemblies such as vesicles) and “information molecules” in processes driven by metabolic reaction networks.           ,                             In contrast to ordinary condensed matter systems, “living systems” are unique. They are based on molecular compartments that reproduce themselves through (i) an uptake of ingredients and energy from the environment, and (ii) spatially and timely coordinated internal chemical transformations. These occur on the basis of instructions encoded in information molecules (DNAs). Life originated on Earth about 4 billion years ago as self-organised systems of inorganic compounds and organic molecules including macromolecules (               e.g.               nucleic acids and proteins) and low molar mass amphiphiles (lipids). Before the first living systems emerged from non-living forms of matter, functional molecules and dynamic molecular assemblies must have been formed as prebiotic soft matter systems. These hypothetical cell-like compartment systems often are called “protocells”. Other systems that are considered as bridging units between non-living and living systems are called “minimal cells”. They are synthetic, autonomous and sustainable reproducing compartment systems, but their constituents are not limited to prebiotic substances. In this review, we focus on both membrane-bounded (vesicular) protocells and minimal cells, and provide a membrane physics background which helps to understand how morphological transformations of vesicle systems might have happened and how vesicle reproduction might be coupled with metabolic reactions and information molecules. This research, which bridges matter and life, is a great challenge in which soft matter physics, systems chemistry, and synthetic biology must take joined efforts to better understand how the transformation of protocells into living systems might have occurred at the origin of life.},

  abstract = {The study of interactions between biomimetic membranes and micron-sized particles serves as a fundamental cornerstone for understanding various biological processes. Here, we aim at controlling the engulfment of microparticles in absence of any externally applied force. We investigate systems involving particles and lipid vesicles, where interactions are primarily mediated by electrostatics. Our attention is directed towards dissipative phenomena at the micron and nano scales occurring between a vesicle membrane and a particle, highlighting the influence of the particle penetration depth and the impact of substructures on particle friction. Our work is complemented by hydrodynamic simulations considering the impacts of the shape of the membrane wrapping the particle and the water gap separating the lipid bilayer membrane and the particle on the translational particle drag. Lastly, we explore a system of aqueous microdroplets in oil, stabilized by a single lipid layer and compare the friction experienced by a particle in contact with this monolayer to the friction observed for particles wrapped by lipid bilayers. Surprisingly, the particle drag is higher on the lipid monolayer than the bilayer, which can be explained by introducing a drag contribution due to the partial wetting dynamics of the particle at the monolayer interface.},

  abstract = {Lipid membranes are abundant in living organisms, where they constitute a surrounding shell for cells and their organelles. There are many circumstances in which the deformations of lipid membranes are involved in living cells: fusion and fission, membrane-mediated interaction between membrane inclusions, lipid–protein interaction, formation of pores, etc. In all of these cases, elastic parameters of lipid membranes are important for the description of membrane deformations, as these parameters determine energy barriers and characteristic times of membrane-involved phenomena. Since the development of molecular dynamics (MD), a variety of in silico methods have been proposed for the determination of elastic parameters of simulated lipid membranes. These MD methods allow for the consideration of details unattainable in experimental techniques and represent a distinct scientific field, which is rapidly developing. This work provides a review of these MD approaches with a focus on theoretical aspects. Two main challenges are identified: (i) the ambiguity in the transition from the continuum description of elastic theories to the discrete representation of MD simulations, and (ii) the determination of intrinsic elastic parameters of lipid mixtures, which is complicated due to the composition–curvature coupling effect.},

  abstract = {Vesicles consisting of a bilayer membrane of amphiphilic lipid molecules are remarkably flexible surfaces that show an amazing variety of shapes of different symmetry and topology. Owing to the fluidity of the membrane, shape transitions such as budding can be induced by temperature changes or the action of optical tweezers. Thermally excited shape fluctuations are both strong and slow enough to be visible by video microscopy. Depending on the physical conditions, vesicles adhere to and unbind from each other or a substrate. This article describes the systematic physical theory developed to understand the static and dynamic aspects of membrane and vesicle configurations. The preferred shapes arise from a competition between curvature energy, which derives from the bending elasticity of the membrane, geometrical constraints such as fixed surface area and fixed enclosed volume, and a signature of the bilayer aspect. These shapes of lowest energy are arranged into phase diagrams, which separate regions of different symmetry by continuous or discontinuous transitions. The geometrical constraints affect the fluctuations around these shapes by creating an effective tension.},

The solution to this equation shows an overdamped oscillatory approach to a stationary tanktreading shape. Inclination angle and ellipticity of the contour are determined as a function of excess area and shear rate. Comparisons to numerical results and experiments are discussed.},

Force and torque transfers between the active particle and the vesicle is also described.

  abstract = {Understanding interactions between microparticles and lipid membranes is of increasing importance, especially for unraveling the influence of microplastics on our health and environment. Here, we study how a short-ranged adhesive force between microparticles and model lipid membranes causes membrane-mediated particle assembly. Using confocal microscopy, we observe the initial particle attachment to the membrane, then particle wrapping, and in rare cases spontaneous membrane tubulation. In the attached state, we measure that the particle mobility decreases by 26\%. If multiple particles adhere to the same vesicle, their initial single-particle state determines their interactions and subsequent assembly pathways: 1) attached particles only aggregate when small adhesive vesicles are present in solution, 2) wrapped particles reversibly attract one another by membrane deformation, and 3) a combination of wrapped and attached particles form membrane-mediated dimers, which further assemble into a variety of complex structures. The experimental observation of distinct assembly pathways, induced only by a short-ranged membrane-particle adhesion, shows that a cytoskeleton or other active components are not required for microparticle aggregation. We suggest that this membrane-mediated microparticle aggregation is a reason behind reported long retention times of polymer microparticles in organisms.},

We observe that the distribution is bi-exponential in nature. Near the boundary, the distribution exhibits rapid exponential decay, transitioning to a slower exponential decay, and eventually becoming uniform further away from the boundary. The length scales associated with the decay are found to depend on the confinement radius. We interpret these observations using molecular simulations and analytical calculations based on the Fokker-Planck equation for an Active Brownian Particle model. Our findings reveal that the small length scale is strongly influenced by the translational diffusion coefficient, while the larger length scale is governed by rotational diffusivity and self-propulsion. These results are explained in terms of two dimensionless parameters that explicitly include the confinement radius. The scaling behavior predicted analytically for the observed length scales is confirmed through simulations.},

Theoretical considerations have led to the idea that the membrane itself mediates protein selforganization in these processes through minimization of membrane curvature energy. Here, we present a combined experimental and numerical study in which we quantify these interactions directly for the first time. In our experimental model system we control the deformation of a lipid membrane by adhering colloidal particles. Using confocal microscopy, we establish that these membrane deformations cause an attractive interaction force leading to reversible binding. The attraction extends over 2.5 times the particle diameter and has a strength of three times the thermal energy (−3.3 kBT). Coarse-grained Monte-Carlo simulations of the system are in excellent agreement with the experimental results and prove that the measured interaction is independent of length scale. Our combined experimental and numerical results reveal membrane curvature as a common physical origin for interactions between any membrane-deforming objects, from nanometre-sized proteins to micrometresized particles.},
