# Abstract 
Abstract Phagocytic particle uptake is crucial for the fate of both living cells and pathogens. Invading particles have to overcome fluctuating lipid membranes as the first physical barrier. However, the energy and the role of the fluctuation-based particle-membrane interactions during particle uptake are not understood. We tackle this problem by indenting the membrane of differently composed Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) with optically trapped particles until particle uptake. By continuous 1 MHz tracking and autocorrelating the particle’s positions within 30µs delays for different indentations, the fluctuations’ amplitude, the damping, the mean forces, and the energy profiles were obtained. Remarkably, the uptake energy into a GUV becomes predictable since it increases for smaller fluctuation amplitudes and longer relaxation time. Our observations could be explained by a mathematical model based on continuous suppression of fluctuation modes. Hence, the reduced particle uptake energy for protein-ligand interactions LecA-Gb3 or Biotin-Streptavidin results also from pronounced, low-friction membrane fluctuations.
