> In particular, it was shown that the membrane stiffness and bilayer thickness are two important factors that mediate vesicle size distributions.

> Currently, it is more or less commonly accepted that the equilibrium size distribution of a vesicle population and the stability of each vesicle in the population are determined by a competition between the total curvature free energy of all vesicles and the various sources of entropy of the system, such as vesicle translation and bilayer undulation.
