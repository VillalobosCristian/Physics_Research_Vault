# Abstract 
Bending rigidity measured with [[fluctuation spectroscopy]] is insensitive to the imaging technique: do’s and do not’s when using confocal and phase contrast imaging. , A widely used method to measure the bending rigidity of bilayer membranes is fluctuation spectroscopy, which analyses the thermally-driven membrane undulations of giant unilamellar vesicles recorded with either phase-contrast or confocal microscopy. Here, we analyze the fluctuations of the same vesicle using both techniques and obtain consistent values for the bending modulus. We discuss the factors that may lead to discrepancies.
