# Abstract 
Vesicles consisting of a bilayer membrane of amphiphilic lipid molecules are remarkably flexible surfaces that show an amazing variety of shapes of different symmetry and topology. Owing to the fluidity of the membrane, shape transitions such as budding can be induced by temperature changes or the action of optical tweezers. Thermally excited shape fluctuations are both strong and slow enough to be visible by video microscopy. Depending on the physical conditions, vesicles adhere to and unbind from each other or a substrate. This article describes the systematic physical theory developed to understand the static and dynamic aspects of membrane and vesicle configurations. The preferred shapes arise from a competition between curvature energy, which derives from the bending elasticity of the membrane, geometrical constraints such as fixed surface area and fixed enclosed volume, and a signature of the bilayer aspect. These shapes of lowest energy are arranged into phase diagrams, which separate regions of different symmetry by continuous or discontinuous transitions. The geometrical constraints affect the fluctuations around these shapes by creating an effective tension.

### note 

[[Surface tension]] Â  is the energy cost per unit area associated with deforming a liquid interface. It arises due to the imbalance of intermolecular forces at the interface compared to the bulk.
[[Bending elasticity]]  characterizes the energy associated with bending a membrane away from its preferred curvature. Unlike surface tension, bending elasticity is not solely an energy per unit area but depends on the curvature of the membrane.
Important, bending elasticity is anisotropic, while surface tension is isotropic. 
Unlike surface tension, which is linear in area, bending energy depends quadratically on the deviation of curvature from the spontaneous curvature.

# Overview 


A systematic theory of vesicle configurations is the topic of this article. 'Configurations' is used here in a broad sense including not only the mean shapes as illustrated above but also the thermal excitations of these shapes, the shapes of vesicles adhering to a substrate and dynamical aspects of these configurations.

>  In particular, the fluctuations for 'quasi-spherical' vesicles, which are spherical in the mean, are addressed. This case is important from an experimental perspective since the flicker spectrum yields the bending rigidity, which is the basic material parameter of the fluid membrane.
