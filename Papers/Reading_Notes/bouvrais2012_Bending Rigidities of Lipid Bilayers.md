> The plasma membrane of a cell, that is, a mixture of around 50 wt% of lipids, 40 wt% of proteins, and 10 wt% of carbohydrates, is composed of three distinct layers

> The membrane collective motions lead to three typical elastic deformations: (i) area expansion/compression, (ii) shearing deformation, and (iii) bending deformation, as schematically described in Fig. 3. The membrane responses to these various deformations are characterized by the following constants: shear elastic modulus m, area compressibility modulus Ka, bending rigidity k, and [[Gaussian curvature]] modulus kG.
