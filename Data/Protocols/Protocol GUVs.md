## Protocol [[Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs)]]

### 1. Prepare Glass Slides
- Use a diamond tip to break the glass slides in half:
  - Use another slide as a ruler to make a straight scratch.
  - Place the scratched slide on top of another slide with the scratch placed at the edge of the lower slide.
  - Tap the glass so it breaks cleanly at the scratch.
- Clean glass slides $3 \times$ with chloroform.
  - Store in a petri dish lined with paper towel (avoid chloroform touching the petri dish).

### 2. Prepare Lipid Solution
- **$50 \, \mu\mathrm{L}$ per slide to coat**, **$4 \, \mathrm{mM}$ lipid concentration** in chloroform.

### 3. Spin Coat Lipids on Glass Slide
- Spin coating parameters:
  - Spin time: **$120 \, \mathrm{s}$**
  - Spin speed: **$\sim 1000 \, \mathrm{rpm}$**
  - Acceleration time: **$\sim 2.0 \, \mathrm{s}$**
  - Deceleration time: **$\sim 2.0 \, \mathrm{s}$**
- Place slide in the center covering the hole where vacuum is applied.
- Start spinning:
  - During spinning, slowly drip ($\sim 50 \, \mu\mathrm{L}$) lipid solution onto the slide using a Hamilton syringe.
- After coating:
  - Store the slides in a vacuum desiccator for at least **$1 \, \mathrm{h}$**.

### 4. Prepare Spacer
- Clean spacer:
  - Wipe with ethanol on lint-free tissue.
- Clip spacer onto slide with small black clips on all four sides.
  - Remove silver metal parts so it lies flat on the heating plate.

### 5. Hydration
1. Place slide with spacer onto the heating plate at **$60^\circ \mathrm{C}$**.
   - Cover with aluminum foil and wait **$10 \, \mathrm{min}$** for the temperature to stabilize.
2. Add **$500 \, \mu\mathrm{L}$** of Sucrose solution (normally **$200 \, \mathrm{mM}$**) into the spacer.
   - Ensure the whole glass slide inside is covered.
3. Cover again with aluminum foil.
   - Wait **$30 \, \mathrm{min}$** for hydration to take place.
4. Remove GUV solution:
   - Store in an Eppendorf tube.
   - Clean spacer.

### 6. Imaging
- Use **$50\%$** isosomolar Glucose solution and **$50\%$** GUV in Sucrose solution.
- Wait **$15-30 \, \mathrm{min}$** for sedimentation.
