The idea is to revisit the process, to avoid mistakes... 
##  Steps 
- Decide the final volume and **total lipid concentration** 
- Calcule **how many total moles** of lipid that represent 
- **Distribute those moles** among each lipid according to the desired mole percentages (e.g., 99.9% **main lipid**, 0.1% **labeled lipid**).
- **Convert the moles** of each component into  a volume (if you have a stock solution in mg/mL or mmol/L). 
- **Combine** the lipids in chloroform.
# Example 

For the protocol of DOPC. 

• **Total final volume:** 500 µL (0.5 mL)

• **Total final lipid concentration:** 4 mM


• **Lipid composition:** 99.9% DOPC (main lipid) and 0.1% DOPE-Rhodamine 
It suppose to be this values (ask to confirm)
• **DOPC stock:** 25 mg/mL in chloroform (MW $\approx 785$ g/mol)

• **DOPE-Rh stock:** 1 mg/mL in chloroform (MW $\approx 1300$ g/mol)

## Calculation

- Decide the final volume and **total lipid concentration** 
**Final volume** ($V$)  = 0.50 mL

**Final concentration** ($C$)  = 4 mM = 4 µmol/mL

## Calculate Total Lipid (in moles)

$n_{\mathrm{totla}} = V \times C =
