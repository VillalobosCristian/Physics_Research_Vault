The idea is to revisit the process, to avoid mistakes... 
##  Steps 
- Decide the final volume and **total lipid concentration** 
- Calcule **how many total moles** of lipid that represent 
- **Distribute those moles** among each lipid according to the desired mole percentages (e.g., 99.9% **main lipid**, 0.1% **labeled lipid**).
- **Convert the moles** of each component into  a volume (if you have a stock solution in mg/mL or mmol/L). o
